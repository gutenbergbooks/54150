<h2 id="c1">Preface</h2>
<p>The purpose of this volume is to trace the history of the medieval
Latin hymn from the point of view of usage. It must be evident to any
student of a subject which is spread over a thousand years of human
experience in the widening environment of an entire continent that a guiding
thread is needed to show the way. One must not, at the same time,
ignore the fact that a monumental religious literature in the poetic field
is involved. But the hymn is functional, having its greatest significance
as a lyric when employed in an act of worship. Latin hymnology, moreover,
is an aspect of ecclesiastical studies following the history of the
Church through the classical and medieval ages into modern times.</p>
<p>A wider cultural background than the immediate interest of theology
and religion is reflected in the hymns of any age. Here often lie secrets
of interpretation which make possible an appreciation of contemporary
thought.</p>
<p>As the study of the medieval hymn is followed from the standpoint
of life and usage, the antiquarian and the literary critic, who cannot fully
satisfy the quest of the student for reality, must give place to the medieval
worshiper himself who has revealed in its entirety each successive phase
of a hymnological history not yet ended.</p>
<p>For information about the Christian hymn as it existed prior to the
medieval era, the author&rsquo;s <i>Christian Hymns of the First Three Centuries,
Paper IX</i>, a publication of The Hymn Society of America, may be consulted.
This account of primitive Christian hymnody, although pre-medieval,
serves as an introduction to the subject matter of the present
volume.</p>
<p>The pages which follow are intended for the general reader rather
than the specialist in medieval culture or in the classical languages. Biographies
of hymn writers have not been attempted since the literature of this
subject is already extensive. Documentation has been reduced to a minimum.
A <a href="#c11">bibliography</a> has been provided for any who are interested in
specialized fields.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_x">x</div>
<p>It is hoped that this brief study will have a modest part in opening
up to the general reader a field which has never been fully explored in any
language, especially English. An inclusive treatment is not offered here
but one which represents the fruits of a generation of research.</p>
<p>My grateful thanks are due to my friends and co-workers in the fields
of classical studies, hymnology and medieval history who have assisted me
in countless ways, particularly to Dr. Adelaide D. Simpson and Dr. Carl
Selmer, both of Hunter College of the City of New York, who have read
the entire manuscript and offered invaluable criticisms and suggestions.
Among the many librarians who have assisted me in varied centers of
study, I am most indebted to the staff of the Library of Union Theological
Seminary of New York, under Dr. William Walker Rockwell and later
under Dr. Lucy Markley. Finally, I wish to acknowledge my obligation
to those authors and publishers who have granted permission to use certain
translations of Latin hymns which appear in this volume.</p>

<br />Early Middle Ages: Latin Hymns of the Fourth Century</h2>
<h3 id="sc1">I. <span class="sc">The Early Hymn Writers</span></h3>
<p>The first mention of Christian Latin hymns by a known author
occurs in the writings of St. Jerome who states that Hilary, Bishop of Poitiers
(c. 310-366), a noted author of commentaries and theological works,
wrote a <i>Liber Hymnorum</i>.<a class="fn" href="#fnx1_1" id="frx1_1">[1]</a> This collection has never been recovered in
its entirety. Hilary&rsquo;s priority as a hymn writer is attested by Isidore of
Seville (d. 636) who says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hilary, however, Bishop of Poitiers in Gaul, a man of unusual
eloquence, was the first prominent hymn writer.<a class="fn" href="#fnx1_2" id="frx1_2">[2]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>More important than his prior claim is the motive which actuated him, the
defense of the Trinitarian doctrine, to which he was aroused by his controversy
with the Arians. A period of four years as an exile in Phrygia for
which his theological opponents were responsible, made him familiar with
the use of hymns in the oriental church to promote the Arian heresy.
Hilary wrested a sword, so to speak, from his adversaries and carried to the
west the hymn, now a weapon of the orthodox. His authentic extant
hymns, three in number, must have been a part of the <i>Liber Hymnorum</i>.
<i>Ante saecula qui manens</i>, &ldquo;O Thou who dost exist before time,&rdquo; is a hymn
of seventy verses in honor of the Trinity; <i>Fefellit saevam verbum factum
te, caro</i>, &ldquo;The Incarnate Word hath deceived thee (Death)&rdquo; is an Easter
hymn; and <i>Adae carnis gloriosae</i>, &ldquo;In the person of the Heavenly Adam&rdquo;
is a hymn on the theme of the temptation of Jesus.<a class="fn" href="#fnx1_3" id="frx1_3">[3]</a> They are ponderous
in style and expression and perhaps too lengthy for congregational use
since they were destined to be superseded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>In addition to these the hymn <i>Hymnum dicat turba fratrum</i>, &ldquo;Let
your hymn be sung, ye faithful,&rdquo; has been most persistently associated
with Hilary&rsquo;s name. The earliest text occurs in a seventh century manuscript.
It is a metrical version of the life of Jesus in seventy-four lines, written
in the same meter as that of <i>Adae carnis gloriosae</i>.<a class="fn" href="#fnx1_4" id="frx1_4">[4]</a></p>
<p>Pope Damasus, a Spaniard by birth (c. 304-384), is believed to have
written hymns in addition to the <i>Epigrams</i> on the martyrs which constitute
his authentic poetry. It would seem probable that his activities in identifying
and marking the sites associated with the Roman martyrs might have
been supplemented by the production of hymns in their honor. Two hymns
bearing his name are extant, one in praise of St. Andrew the Apostle and
one for St. Agatha. Upon internal evidence the ascription is dubious for
they bear the mark of authorship too late to be considered among the
poems of this famous Pope.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, Ambrose, Bishop of Milan (340-397), remains
the uncontested originator of the medieval Latin hymn as it becomes familiar
to us in a uniform series of metrical stanzas adapted to congregational
use. Like Hilary, Ambrose was born in Gaul.<a class="fn" href="#fnx1_5" id="frx1_5">[5]</a> He was the son of
Ambrose, Prefect of the Gauls, and like his father he attained official appointment
under the Roman government as Consular of Liguria and
Aemilia, with Milan as place of residence. Theological controversy between
the Arians and the orthodox was raging at Milan, the Bishop himself,
Auxentius, having adopted the Arian position. Ambrose at this time
was a catechumen but at the death of Auxentius was obliged to preserve
order when the election of his successor took place. At that very moment
the popular mandate created Ambrose Bishop of Milan at the age of thirty-four
years. The period immediately following his election found him constantly
battling for orthodoxy in a contest which passed beyond the limits
of theological debate to the actual siege of orthodox churches by the Arian
forces.</p>
<p>Ambrose was acquainted with the Syrian practice of hymn singing,
and like Hilary, he recognized the effective use of the hymn by the proponents
of the Arian heresy. It was not long before the congregations in
the basilica at Milan were chanting antiphonally the praises of the Trinity
in a similar form. Ambrose himself recorded his achievement, his biographer
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
Paulinus mentions the event and Augustine in his <i>Confessions</i> describes
the congregational singing which he himself had heard.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We, though as yet unmelted by the heat of Thy Spirit, were
nevertheless excited by the alarm and tumult of the city. Then it
was first instituted that according to the custom of the eastern regions,
hymns and psalms should be sung, lest the people should
faint through the fatigue of sorrow.<a class="fn" href="#fnx1_6" id="frx1_6">[6]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ambrose wrote hymns appropriate for morning and evening worship,
four of which now extant, can be proved to be of his authorship, <i>Aeterne
rerum conditor</i>, &ldquo;Maker of all, eternal King,&rdquo; <i>Deus creator omnium</i>, &ldquo;Creator
of the earth and sky,&rdquo; <i>Iam surgit hora tertia</i>, &ldquo;Now the third hour draws
nigh,&rdquo; and <i>Veni redemptor gentium</i>, &ldquo;Come Redeemer of the earth.&rdquo;<a class="fn" href="#fnx1_7" id="frx1_7">[7]</a>
Many others in keeping with his style and inspiration have been preserved
and subjected to critical study with the result that eighteen hymns on
varied themes are generally conceded to be Ambrosian. Had Ambrose
never conferred upon the church his gift of hymnody he would still remain
one of the great Latin Fathers of the fourth century, in his functions as
statesman, organizer and scholar. His contribution to ecclesiastical poetry
and music have made him influential century after century. In this role
he has spoken directly to multitudes of Christians throughout the world,
many of whom have been unacquainted with his name or unaware that
they were following the Ambrosian tradition of congregational song.
(See <a href="#h1">Illustrative Hymns, I.</a> <i>Splendor paternae gloriae</i>, &ldquo;O Splendor of
God&rsquo;s glory bright.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>Spain shares the honors with Gaul as the birthplace of the earliest
hymn writers, claiming first Damasus and then Prudentius, (348-413?), a
lawyer, judge and poet of his era. Little is known of his life aside from his
literary work which includes two collections of hymns, the <i>Cathemerinon</i>,
a series for the hours of the day and the ecclesiastical seasons and the
<i>Peristephanon</i>, a series of much longer poems in praise of the great martyrs
of the early church. In his effort to learn more of the circumstances
attending their martyrdom, Prudentius went to Rome to visit the scenes
made sacred by their death and sufferings. Neither of these collections
was written for liturgical use but for devotional reading. Both were destined
to be appropriated by compilers of hymnaries, especially in Spain.
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
Hymns from the <i>Cathemerinon</i>, either in their original form or in centos,
spread throughout the Christian church while the martyr hymns were also
drawn upon but to a lesser extent. The hymns selected for festival use are
perhaps most familiar today, for example, for Advent, <i>Corde natus ex
parentis ante mundi exordium</i>, of which the translation &ldquo;Of the Father&rsquo;s
love begotten,&rdquo; suggests the original meter. The Epiphany hymn, <i>O sola
magnarum urbium</i>, &ldquo;Earth hath many a noble city,&rdquo; is also well known.<a class="fn" href="#fnx1_8" id="frx1_8">[8]</a></p>
<p>Considered merely as Latin poetry, the hymns of Hilary, Ambrose
and Prudentius are transitional in their literary character. They belong
neither to the poetry of the Silver Age of Latin literature nor do they represent
the medieval literary tradition. Of the metrical aspect something
will be said presently. By some the Ambrosian hymn is regarded as a daring
innovation and the model from which vernacular European verse was
later to develop. In that case, it constitutes a class by itself. For evidence
of the continuity of Latin poetry from the classical to the medieval age
we must turn to the <i>Carmina</i> of Venantius Fortunatus.</p>
<p>Fortunatus (c. 530-600) was born near Treviso and lived as a youth
in northern Italy, studying at Ravenna. The greater part of his life, however,
was spent in Gaul which he visited first as a pilgrim to the shrine
of St. Martin at Tours, who, he believed, had been instrumental in restoring
his eyesight. At Poitiers he met Queen Rhadegunda, wife of Clothair,
King of Neustria. She had founded a convent at Poitiers and there lived
in retirement. This was his introduction to a life of travel and of intercourse
with the great. He was acquainted with bishops, noblemen and
kings whose praises he sang in many graceful tributes, occasional poems
and epitaphs. Through the influence of Rhadegunda, his lifelong patron
and friend, he was ordained, and after her death he became Bishop of
Poitiers, 597, where he lived until his death. As a churchman he was an
admirer and biographer of the saints of Gaul, preeminently St. Martin
whose life and miracles he recounted in poetic form.</p>
<p>Fortunatus seems to have carried with him from the Italian scenes
associated with the poetry of Virgil&mdash;an inspiration which was never entirely
lost. His poems suggest a familiarity with the literary background
of classical verse. During his mature life he lived in the environment of
sixth century Gallic society which was already assuming its medieval
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
Frankish outlines. Natural beauty and human companionship were alike
important to him. He was acquainted with men and women of every degree
from the monarch to the slave.</p>
<p>Although the spirit of religious devotion and of orthodox belief is
evident in many of the hundreds of lyrics which he composed, four only
may be classed as hymns. Three of these are concerned with the theme
of the Holy Cross, <i>Pange lingua, gloriosi proelium certaminis</i>, &ldquo;Sing, my
tongue, the glorious battle,&rdquo; <i>Vexilla regis prodeunt</i>, &ldquo;The banners of the
king advance,&rdquo; and <i>Crux benedicta nitet</i>, &ldquo;Radiant is the blessed cross.&rdquo;
The fourth, <i>Tempora florigero rutilant distincta sereno</i>, &ldquo;Season of luminous
days, marked bright with the birth of the flowers,&rdquo; is a Resurrection
hymn.<a class="fn" href="#fnx1_9" id="frx1_9">[9]</a> It is impossible to indicate here the extraordinary influence which
this group of hymns has exerted in the evolution of Christian hymnody,
continuing in Gaul the tradition, as it were, which Hilary first established.
The circumstances of their origin and their lasting values will be considered
in connection with processional hymns in <a href="#c7">Chapter VI</a>.</p>
<p>(See <a href="#h2">Illustrative Hymns, II.</a> <i>Vexilla regis prodeunt</i>, &ldquo;The banners of the
king advance.&rdquo;)</p>
<h3 id="sc2">II. <span class="sc">Metrical Forms</span></h3>
<p>The problem of metrical forms and the prosody of the earliest Latin
hymns, in general, is a phase of the same problem affecting Latin poetry
as a whole. The subject is both complicated and obscure, entangled with
that of Latin rhetorical prose style, the transition from the quantitative accent
of ancient classical poetry to the stress accent of medieval and modern
verse and with the origin of rhyme. It is a problem for specialists among
whom opinions are now divergent. Toward a practical understanding of
the metrical values of the hymns of Hilary, Prudentius, Ambrose and
Fortunatus, the pragmatic test of what is singable may be applied. The
ancient balanced rhythms of Semitic poetry as illustrated in the Hebrew
psalms had been sung for generations. The metrical lyrics of ancient Greece
were sung to an instrumental accompaniment as were the Latin lyrics of
the Golden Age of Rome. These highly polished classical forms were for
the elite. Of popular poetry which was sung in the period immediately
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
preceding the appearance of the Latin hymn, very little is known. The
early writers were experimenters. Hilary used classical meters with alterations,
of which the trochaic tetrameter catalectic proved most acceptable.<a class="fn" href="#fnx1_10" id="frx1_10">[10]</a>
It is illustrated in <i>Adae carnis gloriosae</i> and also in hymns by Prudentius
and Fortunatus. Prudentius used a variety of meters in addition to the
trochaic which proved adaptable in actual liturgical practice but by that
time stress accent was beginning to obscure the original quantitative values.
Ambrose used the unrhymed iambic dimeter, a simple and singable form
which has been in vogue ever since, at first unrhymed after the original
models and later rhymed. The popular trochaic meter familiarized by
Hilary, Prudentius and Fortunatus, when transformed by stress accent
and rhyme, is easily recognized both in Latin and the vernaculars. Fortunatus
popularized the elegiac meter in hymns for a thousand years by demonstrating
its use in <i>Tempora florigero</i>. Prior to the ninth century revival
of hymnody, the Ambrosian hymn, considered as a metrical model, in comparison
with all other existing models, dominates the field equally with its
prestige as an expression of Christian theology and devotion.</p>
<h3 id="sc3">III. <span class="sc">Hymns in Worship</span></h3>
<p>It is evident that the fourth century was one of innovation in the
custom of congregational singing as the Ambrosian hymn was more widely
diffused. Our knowledge of what actually took place is very incomplete,
based first upon the writing of Ambrose and his contemporaries and later
upon the hints derived from monastic usage. That morning and evening
services of prayer and praise were common is well known. That the singing
of the new fourth century hymns was an integral part of such services
is largely assumed. Prudentius wrote hymns for the evening ceremony of the
lucernare or lighting of the candles, a Christian practice adopted from the
Greek church, to which many references are found. The fact that the
hymns of Prudentius were in existence long before they appeared in the
records of formal worship points to early Christian usage, however dimly
perceived.</p>
<p>Concerning music we learn from the most recent researches that
&ldquo;nothing definite is known of the melodies that were actually applied to
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
the hymns of St. Ambrose.&rdquo;<a class="fn" href="#fnx1_11" id="frx1_11">[11]</a> The traditional liturgical music of Milan
is known as the Ambrosian Chant. It cannot be traced to Ambrose himself
but is supposed to have existed in a simpler form than that which
appears in available manuscripts beginning with the twelfth century. At
least it may be said to have existed prior to the Roman Chant and perhaps
have influenced the latter. With a frank acknowledgement of ignorance
as to the antiphonal melodies which thrilled St. Augustine at Milan, the
possibility must be admitted that they reflected to some extent the formal
music of the synagogue or the music of the Greeks or the elements of contemporary
folk music because these were the musical materials of which
the Christians had experience. All three may have been represented, but
for a hymn of the Ambrosian type, the chant as evolved in rendering the
Gospels or the Psalms may have given place to a form of song more characteristic
of the lyric.</p>
<h3 id="sc4">IV. <span class="sc">Themes</span></h3>
<p>The tradition of Christian hymnology which upholds a way of life is
fundamental in Ambrosian and contemporary hymns. The &ldquo;way&rdquo; is the
first term by which Christianity was designated in the Scriptures. Thus to
the Scriptures the hymn writers turned for the living characterization of
their themes. The call to a virtuous life is sounded in <i>Splendor paternae
gloriae</i> quoted above. Similarly throughout these hymns, the high ideal
of faith, purity, hope, patience, humility and love and the ethical teachings
derived from the words of Jesus and from the early exemplars of the
Christian religion are clearly expressed and enjoined. Not alone for contemporaries
in a period of crisis and controversy were these hymns effective.
They have continued to speak the same words in the same spirit of
joy and devotion derived from contact with the earlier springs of faith to
every succeeding century.</p>
<p>The writings of men familiar with Roman civilization and trained in
classical culture would naturally be presumed to retain the flavor of a non-Christian
literature. Christianity had already appropriated from the pagan
philosophers those teachings which were congenial to its own. Ambrose
reveals both in his poetic and prose writings his acquaintance with classical
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
thought and literary models. Prudentius mingles the classical and the
Christian. Fortunatus was inspired by classical poetry to a Christian expression
of beauty in form and content. But in every case, these characteristics
are marginal. The core of their hymns is the scriptural narrative.
Not only is the subject matter faithfully reproduced but the actual text is
sometimes embedded in the verse. The result is a rare objectivity and a
lack of embellishment especially in the works of Ambrose which became
the preferred standard for later writers.<a class="fn" href="#fnx1_12" id="frx1_12">[12]</a></p>
<p>The life of Jesus is a favorite theme particularly in those episodes
which were described and expanded in hymns for the Nativity, Epiphany,
Passion, Easter and Pentecost. From the episode of the Nativity the praise
of the Virgin was developed. The doctrine of the Trinity was everywhere
upheld in hymns, even as its defense had been influential in their creation.</p>
<p>The group of hymns which praise the early Christian leaders, either
directly or by incidental mention, form a nucleus for the impressive medieval
hymnology of the saints. The Apostles have first place both in chronology
and importance. Prudentius praised the Roman martyrs and Ambrose
those of Rome and Milan as well. Both honored Laurence the Deacon
and Agnes the Virgin. To the praise of the whole group &ldquo;the noble army
of martyrs,&rdquo; the hymn <i>Aeterna Christi munera</i>, &ldquo;The eternal gifts of Christ
the King,&rdquo; was written, unrivalled as a martyr hymn in any period of Latin
hymnology.</p>
<p>(See <a href="#h3">Illustrative Hymns, III.</a> <i>Aeterna Christi munera</i>, &ldquo;The eternal gifts
of Christ the King.&rdquo;)</p>

<h2 id="c3"><span class="jr small">CHAPTER TWO</span>
<br />Early Middle Ages: The Old Hymnal</h2>
<h3 id="sc5">I. <span class="sc">The Hymn Cycles</span></h3>
<p>We owe the preservation of the earliest Latin hymns to monastic
practice. When the founders of monasticism in the west, Caesarius and
Aurelian who were famous bishops of Arles (6th C.), and Benedict (d.
543), founder of the Benedictine Order, organized the regulations and
routine for the communities under their charge, they incorporated Latin
hymns already existing into the daily worship of the monastery.<a class="fn" href="#fnx2_1" id="frx2_1">[1]</a> These
were sung at the services of the canonical hours and were known as hour
hymns or office hymns.</p>
<p>A continuity can be traced, although faintly, from primitive Christian
observances. Beginning with the vigil of Saturday night in preparation
for the following Sunday, the first three centuries of Christian history
developed public services for prayer at candlelight, night time, and
dawn. By the fourth century, the tide of devotional practice had set in,
bringing with it daily worship in the church at the third, sixth and ninth
hours. At the end of the fourth and during the fifth century the cycle was
completed with new offices at sunrise and nightfall. The full series, therefore,
included the nocturnal cursus; vespers, compline, matins (nocturns
and lauds), and the diurnal cursus; prime, terce, sext and nones.<a class="fn" href="#fnx2_2" id="frx2_2">[2]</a> An opportunity
was afforded to unify the services and at the same time to make
use of the symbolic number seven by reference to <i>Psalm 119: 164 (Ps. 118,
Vulgate)</i>, &ldquo;Seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous
ordinances.&rdquo; From the simple assemblies of early Christianity, therefore,
and the daily offices of prayer, a fully elaborated cycle of hymns in time
developed, appropriate to the symbolism of the seven hours and to the
needs of the annual feasts. Constantly increasing in number and variety,
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
these cycles were preserved in psalters together with the psalms or in a
hymnary by themselves. In fact, the word <i>hymn</i> came to mean specifically
an office hymn later to be associated with the breviary, and the word
<i>hymnal</i>, a cycle or collection of office hymns.</p>
<p>At first the cycles were brief. Five extant manuscripts reveal the sixth
century group of hymns of which the best representative, the so-called
Psalter of the Queen from the famous collection of Queen Christine of
Sweden, probably dates from the time of Charles Martel (d. 741).<a class="fn" href="#fnx2_3" id="frx2_3">[3]</a> This
group of hymns is usually referred to as the <i>Old Hymnal</i>, the initial version
of which numbers thirty-four hymns but at the close of the sixth
century had increased to perhaps sixty hymns in actual use.<a class="fn" href="#fnx2_4" id="frx2_4">[4]</a> The thirty-four
original hymns of the <i>Old Hymnal</i> are listed in the <a href="#sc9">Appendix</a> to this
chapter where the appropriate location of each is indicated, whether for
daily or seasonal worship.</p>
<p>Due to the influence of Benedict who had enjoined the use of the
Ambrosian hymn, the authentic verse of Ambrose was preserved and extensively
imitated among the regular clergy. What had become of the
hymn in secular worship?</p>
<p>The old prejudice against non-scriptural hymns and in favor of the
Psalms had never died out. By a canon of the Council of Laodicea (c.
364), <i>psalmi idiotici</i> or &ldquo;private hymns&rdquo; were forbidden, a mandate which
was valid during the lifetime of Ambrose who, nevertheless, ignored a restriction
intended to safeguard orthodoxy but hardly applicable in his case.
In the sixth century the secular clergy of Spain were forbidden to use
hymns by the Council of Braga, 563.<a class="fn" href="#fnx2_5" id="frx2_5">[5]</a> The paradox of encouraging non-scriptural
hymns in the monastery and forbidding their use in the church
at large has been explained by reference to the contemporary appearance
of early forms of vernacular speech in western Europe. Latin, the language
of the church, its liturgy and its clergy, was now threatened by a
possible inroad of the vernacular.<a class="fn" href="#fnx2_6" id="frx2_6">[6]</a> Hymn writing was regarded, perhaps,
as a prerogative of the clergy to be kept within bounds. To throw open
to the church everywhere these privileges might be dangerous alike for
theology and worship. Learning in the Latin tongue tended to be concentrated
in the monastery, for other centers of scholarship were few and far
between; hymnology became largely a function of the monastic group.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>It should be remembered that these centuries embraced a period of
the greatest political, economic and social confusion in western Europe
during which we know relatively little about Christian worship in widespread
congregations except for the rite of the mass. Yet in the sixth century
the opposite tendency toward greater freedom in writing and singing
hymns was apparent. The Council of Tours, 567, permitted the secular
clergy to use Ambrosian and other hymns.<a class="fn" href="#fnx2_7" id="frx2_7">[7]</a> If viewed in this light, the
religious verse of Fortunatus takes on a new significance, illustrative of the
freedom which the Church in Gaul, always highly individual, now experienced
in the realm of hymnology.</p>
<p>Gaul, then, was the scene of a conflict in which the Latin hymn was
contending, and that successfully, for its very life. On the monastic side,
anonymous clerics, using the Ambrosian model, gradually provided the
full complement of hymns for the annual festivals in harmony with the
liturgical year which began to emerge and resemble somewhat its present
form. Wherever the Benedictine Order penetrated into the territories of
western Europe, the use of hymns likewise increased. Their diffusion must
be regarded as comparable with that of an organization which within two
hundred years of the death of its founder boasted hundreds of monasteries
and convents throughout western Christendom, augmented by Irish
and other foundations which had adopted the Benedictine Rule. Missionary
zeal had played a significant role in this expansion. Fulda, for instance,
a community with 400 monks and many missionaries at its disposal, was
able under Willibald to extend its influence through numerous subordinate
monasteries and convents. Royal favor, already enjoyed by St. Gall
and now conferred upon new establishments, rivalled that of popes and
synods, which at the time of Pippin&rsquo;s coronation in 750 or 752, combined
to insure the success of the Benedictine program.<a class="fn" href="#fnx2_8" id="frx2_8">[8]</a></p>
<p>On the side of secular worship, the hymnal used by Benedict and his
successors gradually gained a foothold in the church through diocesan centers
which adopted the monastic cycles. Or perhaps it may be said, with
the reservation that we are in the realm of theory and not of fact, that the
ancient hymns written prior to the sixth century had been circulated and
continued to be circulated in the west in a way not at present understood,
in connection with the Gallican or ancient liturgy of Gaul. If so, the <i>Old
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
Hymnal</i> is the Gallican hymnal which Benedict appropriated and his followers
maintained to its acknowledged prestige by the year 750.</p>
<p>An episode of significance for hymnology during the period under
consideration in this chapter is the activity of Gregory the Great who occupied
the papal throne from 590 to 604. A member of the Benedictine
Order, he is noted for his enthusiastic support of its missionary program
and for his interest in ecclesiastical music and poetry. His role in the extension
of the Roman Rite and of the Benedictine Order to Britain is
familiar to all.<a class="fn" href="#fnx2_9" id="frx2_9">[9]</a> His authority in the western church is a matter not of
controversy but of fact. That he was deeply interested both in hymn
writing and singing may be safely assumed for there are too many reports
of his activity to be ignored. His actual role in the development of the
chant which bears his name and the authorship of eight to eleven hymns
attributed to him, have not been determined. For Gregory&rsquo;s contribution
to the ritual music of the church the reader is referred to the discussion
of this subject by specialists in the field of liturgical music. For his contribution
to the hymn cycles, modern hymnologists have judged even the
eight hymns singled out as Gregorian by Benedictine editors, to be doubtful
although the nocturn and vesper hymns may be authentic.<a class="fn" href="#fnx2_10" id="frx2_10">[10]</a> Aside
from critical research the fact remains that all these hymns appear in the
cycles of the day and several have been in liturgical use to the present
time. They are representative of the hymnology of the transition between
the <i>Old Hymnal</i> and the later cycles whose hidden origins Gregory may
have influenced.</p>
<p>(See <a href="#h4">Illustrative Hymns, IV.</a> <i>Nocte surgentes vigilemus omnes</i>, &ldquo;Father
we praise Thee, now the night is over.&rdquo;)</p>
<h3 id="sc6">II. <span class="sc">Mozarabic Contributions</span></h3>
<p>The list of hymns in the <i>Old Hymnal</i> (See <a href="#sc9">Appendix</a>) reveals at a
glance the presence of nine Mozarabic hymns. Mozarabic is a term applied
to the Christian inhabitants of Spain under Moslem rule and also
to the rites of the Christian Church prevailing throughout the Visigothic
and Moslem periods. It is the former or Visigothic period extending from
the foundation of the Kingdom by Euric, 466, to the entry of the Moslems
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
in 711, which claims our attention here. Connections between Spain and
Gaul at this time were very close for the Visigoths ruled a large part of
what is now southern France from the Atlantic to the Maritime Alps. The
great churchmen of Spain, especially Isidore, Archbishop of Seville (d.
636), performed the same service for Christian hymns in Spain which
the monastic leaders performed in Gaul. In his <i>Etymologiae</i> and his <i>De
officiis ecclesiasticis</i>, Isidore considers the subject of music and liturgy. His
<i>Regula monachorum</i>, built partly on older rules observed in Spain, is an
evidence of his interest in monastic reform. As presiding bishop of the IV
Council of Toledo, 633, he was at the height of his reputation.<a class="fn" href="#fnx2_11" id="frx2_11">[11]</a> Braulio,
Bishop of Saragossa, (631-651), his pupil and literary executor, bears witness
to his fame.<a class="fn" href="#fnx2_12" id="frx2_12">[12]</a> He himself maintained the liturgical tradition which was
continued with great success by Eugenius II, Primate of Toledo, (646-657),
Ildefonsus who held the same rank, (659-667), and others. As the result of
the literary and liturgical movement initiated by these leaders, supported
by the councils and schools, the Mozarabic hymnology was rapidly developed.
The canons of the IV Council of Toledo, for which Isidore may
have been personally responsible, require uniformity of the rites and offices
throughout Spain and Gaul. The thirteenth canon upholds the validity
and appropriateness of hymns by Christian authors against those who
would restrict the hymnody of the Church to the Psalms of the Old Testament.
After a discussion of the old prohibitions and the reasons for approving
the new compositions, Canon 13 reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;As with prayers, so also with hymns written for the praise of
God, let no one of you disapprove of them but publish them
abroad both in Gaul and Spain. Let those be punished with excommunication
who have ventured to repudiate hymns.&rdquo;<a class="fn" href="#fnx2_13" id="frx2_13">[13]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Building upon the work of Ambrose, Sedulius and notably Prudentius,
their own countryman; adapting ancient traditions of congregational
worship and monastic usage, the liturgists of the seventh century must
have collated for the use of the clergy approximately sixty-five hymns from
sources originating prior to their own day. These ancient hymns form the
nucleus of the Mozarabic Hymnal, the earliest manuscript of which dates
from the tenth century. They reveal interrelations between the Spanish
and Gallican churches and they indicate a continuity of hymn singing from
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
primitive congregational usage like the Ambrosian to the seventh century

<h3 id="sc7">III. <span class="sc">Celtic Hymns</span></h3>
<p>The Celtic inhabitants of the British Isles from the period of the introduction
of Christianity maintained individual features of liturgy and
organization, especially in their monastic groups. The contemporary Saxon
Church of the seventh century, however, had been drawn into the Roman
sphere of influence by Gregory the Great who was also in touch with
Celtic leadership. The ancient record of the interchange of hymns written
respectively by St. Columba of Iona and by Gregory preserves more than
a report incapable of proof.<a class="fn" href="#fnx2_15" id="frx2_15">[15]</a> It points to reciprocal interest in the evolving
hymnology of the sixth and seventh centuries in Celtic and continental
regions.</p>
<p>The so-called Bangor Antiphonary of the seventh century is the
earliest manuscript containing hymns, twelve in number.<a class="fn" href="#fnx2_16" id="frx2_16">[16]</a> Its contents
are otherwise miscellaneous, including a list of the abbots of Bangor.
Hilary&rsquo;s supposed hymn from this collection, <i>Hymnum dicat turba fratrum</i>,
has already been cited. An ancient communion hymn, <i>Sancti venite
Christi corpus sumite</i>, &ldquo;Draw nigh and take the body of the Lord,&rdquo; is included
and <i>Mediae noctis tempus est</i>, &ldquo;It is the midnight hour,&rdquo; an office
hymn common to the hymnals of Spain and Gaul. Among other important
sources is the Irish <i>Liber hymnorum</i>, preserved in an eleventh century
manuscript of Dublin which contains Columba&rsquo;s hymn, <i>Altus prosator</i>,
&ldquo;Ancient of days,&rdquo; honoring God the creator, and the <i>Lorica</i> or <i>Breastplate
Hymn</i> of St. Gildas (6th C.), <i>Suffragare trinitatis unitas, unitatis
miserere trinitas</i>, &ldquo;Grant me thy favor, Three in One, have mercy on me,
One in Three.&rdquo;<a class="fn" href="#fnx2_17" id="frx2_17">[17]</a></p>
<p>On the whole Celtic hymns exhibit great variety in subject matter
and purpose with many departures from the type of hymn cycle in use on
the continent. Indeed, the group of from fifteen to twenty hymns produced
in the centuries under consideration are highly distinctive. The Ambrosian
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
tradition is not apparent. Non-Ambrosian meters are illustrated in
all three hymns cited above while alliteration, the <i>abcd</i> form, repetition of
initial words and other metrical devices are found throughout the collection.
There are hymns for the offices and communion, metrical prayers
and a group of hymns for saints, some bearing witness to local cults. Poetic
individuality marks them all.<a class="fn" href="#fnx2_18" id="frx2_18">[18]</a> Contemporaneous with the flowering of
Celtic hymnology, the seventh century saw the beginning of the cultural
invasion of the continent by Celtic scholars, teachers and missionaries
whereby two streams of culture, previously isolated, united with significant
results for the hymnology of the future.</p>
<p>(See <a href="#h6">Illustrative Hymns, VI.</a> <i>Sancti venite Christi corpus sumite</i>, &ldquo;Draw
nigh and take the body of the Lord.&rdquo;)</p>
<h3 id="sc8">IV. <span class="sc">Summary</span></h3>
<p>The account of the Christian hymns of necessity accompanies that of
the Christian organization, moving from the shores of the Mediterranean
and the Christian centers in Roman provincial areas into the &ldquo;regions beyond&rdquo;
of missionary effort. Although congregational singing in the Ambrosian
sense appears to have been submerged in this process, the traditional
hymnody was preserved, new hymns added and the foundation laid
for the ninth century revival.</p>
<p>Anonymity is the rule and known authorship the exception for the
hymns produced in the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth centuries. This
continued to be the rule during the whole medieval period since the
names of those who wrote the non-scriptural parts of religious rites were
lost or unknown or perhaps of little importance in communal worship.
The fact that the hymns which survive have been gathered from liturgical
manuscripts and not from the work of individual authors except in rare
cases, should make anonymity more intelligible.</p>
<p>Hymn sources are scanty and interconnections, dimly perceived, can
rarely be established. Continuity of evolution is often broken or replaced
by new poetical inspiration. However, the fourth century appeal to the
objective, the direct, the simple, is seldom varied by the subjective theme.
The biblical narratives and the symbolism connected with the various offices
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
and feasts add substance and character to the cycles and to the concept
of the liturgical year.</p>
<p>In the heart of the Dark Ages, popularly considered, western European
civilization was in confusion and its fate problematical. One could
scarcely expect the fruits of peace and security to flourish. Yet in these
very centuries there were created and circulated many of the best loved
hymns of Christianity, a number of which have been in unbroken use to
the present day. Among them are the illustrations inserted above and
<i>Lucis Creator optime</i>, &ldquo;O blest creator of the light;&rdquo; the Advent hymns,
<i>Verbum supernum prodiens</i>, &ldquo;High Word of God who once didst come,&rdquo;
and <i>Conditor alme siderum</i>, &ldquo;Creator of the stars of night;&rdquo; the Easter
hymn, <i>Claro paschali gaudio</i>, &ldquo;That Easter day with joy was bright;&rdquo; for
the dedication of a church, <i>Urbs beata Jerusalem</i>, &ldquo;Blessed city, heavenly
Salem&rdquo; with the more familiar second part, &ldquo;Christ is made the sure foundation.&rdquo;
Two hymns honoring the Virgin date from this period: <i>Ave
maris stella</i>, &ldquo;Hail, Sea-Star we name Thee,&rdquo; and <i>Quem terra pontus
aethera</i>, &ldquo;The God whom earth and sea and sky,&rdquo; initiating the Marian
hymnology of the Middle Ages.<a class="fn" href="#fnx2_19" id="frx2_19">[19]</a></p>
<p>(See <a href="#h7">Illustrative Hymns, VII.</a> <i>Ave maris stella</i>, &ldquo;Hail, Sea-Star we name
Thee.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>Created and preserved in a clerical and for the most part a monastic
environment these hymns express the Christian thought and faith of the
era which was thus treasured up for wider circulation and influence in a
later and more settled society. The words of the late Canon Douglas, a
great American hymnologist, are memorable in this connection:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What does have a practical bearing on our subject is, that
whatever may have been the older cycle, it was enriched to an
extraordinary degree in the early medieval centuries. What began
in Milan, and achieved its permanent recognition at Monte
Cassino, was soon to bring about a Mozarabic Hymnal in Spain,
a Gallican hymnal in northern Europe, an Anglo-Irish cycle in
Britain: and from all these various increments not only enlarged
the growing Hymnal but also richly diversified it.&rdquo;<a class="fn" href="#fnx2_20" id="frx2_20">[20]</a></p>

<br />The Ninth Century Revival: Hymns</h2>
<h3 id="sc10">I. <span class="sc">Background of Carolingian Culture</span></h3>
<p>To explain fully the origin of a great literary movement must always
be difficult, for the subtle influences affecting its beginnings elude a scientific
analysis of facts. One observes the revival of Latin hymnology between
750 and 900 A.D. with amazement. The voices of Ambrose, his contemporaries
and his immediate imitators had been silenced for centuries.
Venantius Fortunatus had stood forth, a solitary survival of the old Latin
poetic genius or, perhaps more accurately, a solitary herald of the new
medieval awakening. Then a flowering of religious poetry spread over
western Europe, not to be withered by new barbarian invasions but to be
the permanent possession of the Christian Church.</p>
<p>In this period the older cycles of office hymns were revised and expanded
and fresh cycles created in such numbers as to justify the new
terminology of the <i>Later Hymnal</i> or <i>Ninth Century Hymnal</i>. The sequence
arose in the formal worship of the mass, affording a new inspirational
to clerical poets and resulting in a body of sacred verse of increasing
influence. The processional hymn and its related forms appeared in response
to the new impulse toward a hymnic accompaniment to ceremonial
acts. In effect, the hymn during the period under consideration, was well
established in every aspect of formal worship.</p>
<p>In the background of the age which created this literature must be
sought the trends and motivation which make intelligible the voices of
its interpreters. Accordingly, in the years from 750 to 900 A.D. when the
Carolingian rulers, Pippin, Charlemagne, Louis the Pious and Charles the
Bald were guiding the destinies of the Franks, the various influences affecting
public worship must be surveyed. The most important were the
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
liturgical reforms undertaken or sponsored by the Carolingian rulers; their
promotion of ecclesiastical music and singing; their interest in the reform
and expansion of the Benedictine Order; the literary activity of members
of the Carolingian court circles who devoted themselves to liturgical studies
or poetic expression; the part played by Celtic culture; the infiltration
of Byzantine ideas and arts and the rise of Germanic genius.</p>
<p>The introduction and permanent establishment of the Roman liturgy
in Frankish realms form the background of public worship in the Carolingian
era. When Pippin ascended the throne in 752, the Gallican Rite prevailed.
When the reign of Charles the Bald came to a close in 877, the
Roman Rite was supreme.<a class="fn" href="#fnx3_1" id="frx3_1">[1]</a> Charlemagne received the Gregorian Sacramentary
from Pope Hadrian I.<a class="fn" href="#fnx3_2" id="frx3_2">[2]</a> Stimulated by his desire to unify the Germanic
peoples under papal as well as imperial authority, he brought about
by royal edicts or capitularies a widespread reform in the western continental
church. Those features of his program which affected hymnology
include requirements that priests must be educated, that monks observe
their monastic rule, that the singing of the psalms and the <i>gloria</i> be improved,
that schools of singing and grammar be founded in monastic and
diocesan centers, that both regular and secular clergy be urged to acquire
knowledge and skill in singing, that the Roman Chant be ordained, that
a singing school be established at Aix-la-Chapelle, that the clergy read
and sing well.<a class="fn" href="#fnx3_3" id="frx3_3">[3]</a> Charlemagne&rsquo;s successors, Louis the Pious and Charles
the Bald continued his reforming policy.</p>
<p>In the legislation cited above, Charlemagne had followed his father&rsquo;s
example which favored a training in Gregorian music under Roman teachers,
as developed in the schools of Rome.<a class="fn" href="#fnx3_4" id="frx3_4">[4]</a> Pippin&rsquo;s interest had resulted
in the establishment of a musical center of great repute at Metz<a class="fn" href="#fnx3_5" id="frx3_5">[5]</a> which
also possessed a cathedral school representative of the finest institutions
which flourished at this time side by side with monastic centers of learning.</p>
<p>Charlemagne was presented with a copy of the Benedictine Rule
with choir rules, office and festival hymns, by Theodomar, Abbot of Monte
Cassino, sometime between 787 and 797.<a class="fn" href="#fnx3_6" id="frx3_6">[6]</a> It became his chosen duty to
promulgate the Rule, to require its observance everywhere within his
realms and further to extend the influence of the Order in general. Consequently,
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
monastic centers of music arose, for example, at St. Gall where
the hymnody of the offices was fostered and gradually made available for
the bishoprics as well. Louis the Pious, (814-840), and Charles the Bald,
(843-877), in their turn continued the patronage of the Benedictine Order.
Already fortified by the efforts of Charlemagne, the Benedictines entered
a period of religious and cultural influence which was later merged into
the age of the universities. Linked directly with the program for monastic
reform, the impulse to write new hymns and the encouragement to finer
musical performance together created the annual cycles of this period in
which the older hymns were retained and supplemented by the new.</p>
<p>The writers and literary leaders of the Carolingian period were by
virtue of their clerical profession actively engaged in liturgical studies.
Alcuin compiled the missal which established the Gregorian Sacramentary
in Frankish realms and constituted a recension acceptable to the Roman
Church.<a class="fn" href="#fnx3_7" id="frx3_7">[7]</a> A significant innovation for hymnology was the decorative procession.<a class="fn" href="#fnx3_8" id="frx3_8">[8]</a>
Alcuin was also influential through his devotional works which
supplemented the public worship of the mass and offices. Paulus Diaconus
and Angilbert were second to Alcuin in promoting liturgical studies. The
works of the great writers were accompanied by numerous writings of
lesser importance which bear witness, as will be evident below, to the increasing
practice of hymn-singing. The influence of the Roman Rite,
largely barren of hymns, was at the same period, in contact with the influence
of Benedictine precedent in hymn singing which in the end prevailed.</p>
<p>The Latin poetry associated with the Carolingian era has been edited
and published in a monumental form under the title <i>Poetae Latini Aevi
Carolini</i>.<a class="fn" href="#fnx3_9" id="frx3_9">[9]</a> The collection, produced in the spirit of a classical revival by a
circle of court poets, includes secular as well as religious verse.</p>
<p>Carolingian culture not only in the specific field of literature but in
the broader sense afforded a medium for the spread of Celtic, Byzantine
and Germanic genius. The Celtic portion of the poetry in the early monastic
cycles has already been described in connection with the <i>Old Hymnal</i>.
Prior to the eighth century, a transfer of Celtic scholarship to the continent
began to take place. The missionaries, Columbanus, Gall, Foilan, Disibod
and others, came first, during the seventh and eighth centuries. Refugees,
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
fleeing before the Norse invasions of the late eighth and ninth centuries,
followed. Wanderers and pilgrims crossed the Channel, among them <i>peregrini</i>
who left their homeland to live in new countries as a means of spiritual
satisfaction and reward. Scholars came also who hoped for a more
sympathetic reception for their teachings among the continentals.<a class="fn" href="#fnx3_10" id="frx3_10">[10]</a> On
the whole, Celtic immigrants found a welcome. Charlemagne himself
favored them.<a class="fn" href="#fnx3_11" id="frx3_11">[11]</a> Celtic teachers were proficient in orthography, grammar,
Greek, scriptural and liturgical subjects and the arts.<a class="fn" href="#fnx3_12" id="frx3_12">[12]</a> They brought with
them manuscripts, the influence of which was felt, not only in their subject
matter but in musical notation and characteristic scripts.<a class="fn" href="#fnx3_13" id="frx3_13">[13]</a> The
Bangor Antiphonary, the hymns of which have already been considered,
came to the continent at this time. Among the famous teachers of music
was Marcellus<a class="fn" href="#fnx3_14" id="frx3_14">[14]</a> who, at St. Gall, instructed Notker, Tutilo, Waltram and
Hartmann, a fraternity devoted to finer ecclesiastical music and hymnody.</p>
<p>The role of Byzantine influence cannot be ignored in any account of
the cultural and historical background of ninth century literature. One
should recall that the Carolingian period was an era of general European
intercourse which could not fail to have an effect upon society. The foreign
relations of the Frankish Empire necessitated much traveling, visiting and
correspondence. Warlike as well as peaceful movement, commercial or
cultural, increased the interchange of ideas. There was an overlapping of
boundary lines, too, which amalgated populations. The infiltration of Byzantine
influence might be conceived as a by-product of European intercourse.</p>
<p>Insofar as hymnology is concerned, musical contacts between the
Byzantine and Frankish realms were frequent. As early as Pippin&rsquo;s reign,
Byzantine musicians appeared at the Frankish court with a gift of an organ
from the Emperor Constantinus Copronymus.<a class="fn" href="#fnx3_15" id="frx3_15">[15]</a> Many refugee monks who
fled to the west during the iconoclastic controversy remained there even
after its close in 787, enjoying monastic hospitality and imperial favor.
Charlemagne permitted them to use the Greek language in worship and
was so much impressed by the music employed in chanting the psalms
that he caused it to be adopted for the Latin version also.<a class="fn" href="#fnx3_16" id="frx3_16">[16]</a> The paramount
influence of Byzantine music upon liturgical practice in the west
will be considered more fully in connection with the sequence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>Verifiable traces of Byzantine influence had already appeared with
the activities of Gregory the Great and are entirely comprehensible, so far
as he is concerned, in view of his residence at Constantinople, 579-585, as
papal envoy of Pelagius II.<a class="fn" href="#fnx3_17" id="frx3_17">[17]</a> The importation of litanies into the west
illustrates this type of influence. When Charlemagne received the Sacramentary
from Pope Hadrian I, it was labelled &ldquo;Gregorian.&rdquo; But in the
interval between the lives of Gregory and Charlemagne, popes of eastern
origin, ruling at the end of the seventh and the beginning of the eighth
century were responsible for western practice.<a class="fn" href="#fnx3_18" id="frx3_18">[18]</a> The influence of the
Eastern upon the Western Church seems to have been cumulative, with
Charlemagne in his day acting as the agent for its diffusion throughout
the Frankish Church.</p>
<p>In matters concerning the church and its worship the Greeks were
an acquisition not only as musicians but as scholars and as experts in the
fine arts. Their scholarship was in demand in New Testament studies.
Illustrations of Greek and of oriental inspiration in general are numerous
in architecture, painting, sculpture, ivories, work in precious metals and
the decoration of manuscripts.<a class="fn" href="#fnx3_19" id="frx3_19">[19]</a> Perhaps it was a natural desire to emulate
the splendor and ornament of eastern rites which led Charlemagne to
favor Greek elements in western observance at the expense of the Gallican.</p>
<p>In the midst of Gallic, Celtic, Italian, Byzantine and oriental influences
mingled in Carolingian culture, the presence of native genius is
strongly felt. Charlemagne has been criticized for his devotion to classical
rather than Germanic culture. Sacred poetry as produced in the Carolingian
literary circles, was written in Latin and clothed in classical garb. It
could hardly have been otherwise since Latin was demanded by the
Church and the vernacular languages of western Europe were then in
their early infancy. But in spite of the studied artificiality of this verse, a
note is sometimes heard in harmony with the poetry of later centuries
which emanates from Germanic sources.</p>
<p>Such in brief is the background of that revival of hymnody which
appears in the Carolingian period. It remains to trace, in detail, the evolution
of the monastic hymnal known as the <i>Later</i> or <i>Ninth Century
Hymnal</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<h3 id="sc11">II. <span class="sc">The Later Hymnal</span></h3>
<p>The enlargement and diversification of the Hymnal to which Canon
Douglas referred in the words quoted at the close of Chapter Two, occurred
within the general historical limits of the Carolingian era and with
the exception of Spain and the British Isles, within the general geographical
limits of Carolingian political influence. The hymn cycles of the
period, recorded in manuscripts which reflect the numerical increase in
hymns as well as their diffusion upon the continent, are associated with
religious centers, for example, St. Martial, Laon, Douai, Moissac, St. Germain-des-Pr&eacute;s,
Corbie, Jumi&egrave;ges, Reichenau, Treves, Sch&auml;ftlarn near
Munich, Murbach, Rheinau, St. Gall, Einsiedeln, Bobbio, Monte Cassino,
Benevento, Padua, Toledo, Canterbury, Naples and many other
places. The nucleus of the <i>Later Hymnal</i> has been identified with the
hymn cycle found partly in a <i>hymnarium</i> of the ninth century from St.
Paul&rsquo;s in Lavantthal, Carinthia, and partly in a similar manuscript from
Karlsruh, both manuscripts being associated with Reichenau.<a class="fn" href="#fnx3_20" id="frx3_20">[20]</a> The basic
hymns from this group of sources current in the Carolingian period are
listed in the <a href="#sc13">appendix</a> to this chapter. A complete list of the manuscript
sources (prior to 1100), including the above and others, with an index
of the hymns which they contain, approximately 800 in number, was provided
by James Mearns, the English hymnologist, in his <i>Early Latin Hymnaries</i>.<a class="fn" href="#fnx3_21" id="frx3_21">[21]</a></p>
<p>So much for the evidence as to the actual hymns in use from sources
available at the period when the <i>Later Hymnal</i> flourished. The origin of
the <i>Later Hymnal</i>, however, is far from clear. It has been defined as a
collection arising about the seventh century which superseded the <i>Old
Hymnal</i> and has since prevailed.<a class="fn" href="#fnx3_22" id="frx3_22">[22]</a> This opinion advanced by Blume and
affirmed by Walpole, depends upon the theory that the later cycle had
been in use in the British Isles since the period of Gregory the Great. An
Anglo-Irish cycle therefore, was posited which took possession of the
continent, usurping the original Benedictine hymnal. As early as 1911,
Blume&rsquo;s theory was questioned by Wilmart, the Benedictine scholar, who
asserted that the early cycle constituted a Gallican hymnal only,&mdash;a possibility
mentioned above. He thought that the <i>Later Hymnal</i> was a new
version of the Benedictine cycle representing a normal growth through
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
the centuries. Other critics of note have adopted one or the other viewpoint,
Frere following that of Blume; and Raby, that of Wilmart.<a class="fn" href="#fnx3_23" id="frx3_23">[23]</a> A final
solution is obviously impossible for lack of manuscript evidence.</p>
<p>At the accession of Charlemagne, 768, the future of liturgical hymnody
was uncertain as the forces of Roman usage and Benedictine practice
were in conflict and the possibility of transferring the Benedictine
heritage to the church extremely doubtful, as the preceding survey has
already made clear. Secondary forces, however, were at work to achieve
this very end. First, the early gains made in compiling the Gallican Hymnal
and extending it to the secular clergy were never entirely lost. A precedent
had been set. Second, the Benedictine cycle was enjoined wherever
the Rule was effective and its use was further stimulated by royal capitularies
upon the subject of music and singing. Third, the establishment of
monastic centers of music in the leading Benedictine abbeys was productive
of literary as well as musical effort, attested by the very manuscripts
of hymn collections gathered there. The manuscripts of St. Gall, for
example, cover every department of contemporary medieval hymnology.</p>
<p>Charlemagne was particularly interested in St. Gall but was also
concerned with the monastic centers at Mainz, Fulda, Treves, Cologne,
Bamberg, Hersfeld, Lorsch, W&uuml;rzburg and Reichenau.<a class="fn" href="#fnx3_24" id="frx3_24">[24]</a> He founded
Neustadt and endowed twelve monasteries in Germany. Meanwhile missionary
zeal had guided Benedictine pioneers beyond the old boundaries,
and Bavaria and Frisia had already been opened to missions and incidentally
to the full round of Benedictine activities. Louis the Pious was active
in monastic reform through his association with Benedict of Aniane; he
was a special patron of St. Gall and he stimulated the efforts of leaders
from Corbie to found New Corbie. Charles the Bald was a benefactor of
Marchiennes, Compi&egrave;gne, Prum and St. Denis.<a class="fn" href="#fnx3_25" id="frx3_25">[25]</a> Prior to this period, the
numerous and influential foundations established on the continent by
Irish monks had adopted the Benedictine Rule, swelling the total number
of centers devoted to religious and educational activities.</p>
<p>The numerical increase in the Benedictine abbeys offers in itself presumptive
evidence of a greater use of hymns. What is known of the monastic
centers and their store of hymnaries offers direct proof. A closer bond
between the Order and the cultural activities of the age is found in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
great personalities drawn from Benedictine ranks to serve the imperial designs.
Of particular interest here are the statements regarding hymns and
hymn singing which appear in contemporary writings.</p>
<p>Alcuin was chiefly interested in the Roman liturgy as such but he
wrote <i>De psalmorum usu</i>, <i>Officia per ferias</i> and the <i>Epistolae</i>, the last of
which shows a special interest in music. Rabanus Maurus testifies to the
general use of hymns by secular as well as regular clergy. Amalarius of
Metz mentions the use of hymns outside the monasteries. Walafrid Strabo
traces the use of hymns from the time of Ambrose and repeats the Canon
of Toledo recommending hymns. He says that churches which do not use
hymns are exceptional.<a class="fn" href="#fnx3_26" id="frx3_26">[26]</a> The testimony is scattered but it points to the
adoption of the hymnal by the secular clergy. It should also be recalled
that the Ambrosian tradition of musical independence was constantly maintained
at Milan.</p>
<p>As the Latin language became more and more an exclusive clerical
possession, the old safeguards provided by monastic walls were no longer
necessary. The whole body of clergy whether regular or secular became
the custodians of the hymnaries used in monastic and diocesan centers of
music and scholarship.<a class="fn" href="#fnx3_27" id="frx3_27">[27]</a> The Christian laity of Europe at this period may
have been largely ignorant of their hymnic heritage because the Carolingian
extension of hymn writing and hymn singing occurred within clerical
ranks. There was at this time scant indication of the future course of
Latin hymnology which would ultimately restore to the layman his original
possession handed down from the Early Christian Church.</p>
<p>The poetical writings of the era included a substantial body of religious
verse from which hymns are attributed to the following authors:
Paulus Diaconus, 1; Paulinus of Aquileia, 7; Alcuin, 3; Theodulphus, 1;
Rabanus Maurus, 2; Walafrid Strabo, 5; Florus of Lyons, 2; Wandelbert
of Prum, 1; Paulus Albarus of Cordova, 1; Cyprian and Samson, 2; Sedulius
Scottus, 2; Milo, 2; Ratbod, 2; Hucbald, 1; Hartmann, 4; Ratpert, 4;
Eugenius Vulgarius, 1; these with 73 of doubtful authorship make a total
contribution of 114 hymns.</p>
<p>(See <a href="#h8">Illustrative Hymns, VIII.</a> <i>Ut queant laxis resonare fibris</i>, &ldquo;In flowing
measures worthily to sing,&rdquo; Paulus Diaconus.)</p>
<p>Ambrosian meters are set aside in favor of the classical meters of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
Greeks, the Sapphic and elegiac meters proving to be the most popular
thereafter. To what extent this influence is actually observable in hymn
cycles may be determined by a comparison of the list of Carolingian hymns
with the lists of hymns provided by Blume, Julian or Mearns. Batiffol selected
thirteen as found in later breviary lists<a class="fn" href="#fnx3_28" id="frx3_28">[28]</a> but the actual direct contribution
is much larger if other than breviary hymns are admitted. Moreover,
the literary and liturgical studies of the time broadened the original
Benedictine concept that the hymns of the monastic cycle should be Ambrosian
in style. The hymns of Sedulius and particularly of Prudentius
and Fortunatus were recognized, introduced or freely adapted to ecclesiastical
usage.</p>
<p>The direct influence of Celtic culture upon the new hymn cycles
must be associated with the introduction of biblical and liturgical works
containing hymns into Frankish territory. Later, hymns were written by
Celtic scholars, for instance, Samson, Sedulius Scottus (enumerated
above) and possibly others who are anonymous. Blume&rsquo;s theory of the
Anglo-Irish hymn cycle, originally sponsored by Gregory the Great and
finally transferred to the continent, illustrates the most decisive form which
Celtic influence has so far been presumed to have exerted. The list of
hymns (see <a href="#sc13">Appendix</a>) bears, on the contrary, no resemblance to the group
of contemporary Celtic hymns.<a class="fn" href="#fnx3_29" id="frx3_29">[29]</a> It seems much more probable that Gregory,
the Benedictine Pope, approved the use in Anglo-Irish lands, of the
continental hymn cycle which the Order was responsible for carrying
northward with it when it entered Britain. In any case, the Benedictine
cycles from the ninth century onward are enriched from every aspect of
the diverse culture of the age, in which the Celtic contribution, both direct
and indirect, is important.</p>
<p>At this period hymnology in the Greek-speaking world was at its
height. Yet proof is sought in vain that Greek hymns were used in the
west, either in the Greek language or in translation. The hymnal of the
Western Church received from Greek sources its recorded tunes, not its
words. Although the earliest liturgical manuscript with musical notation
dates from the ninth century, the Greeks had already given their neumes
to the west. As for the hymn melodies which are crystallized in these
manuscripts when they do appear, theories of origin abound. A definite
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
system of notation was in existence from the seventh century but hymns
had been sung from the fourth century.</p>
<p>In modern times through the consecrated efforts of Benedictine students
of the chant, working chiefly at Solesmes, a collation of the existing
musical manuscripts produced in the Middle Ages, has been made. Their
object has been to determine the authentic melodies of the Benedictine
cycle throughout its long history. Today the results of their scholarship
are available to the public and the great hymns which they have fostered
may be heard as well as read in their medieval form.</p>
<p>The assimilation by the Franks, of alien cultures whether through
conquest or peaceful interchange, may have been to a certain extent inevitable
and involuntary. Such phenomena occur in every period of history.
It is the conscious appropriation by the Carolingian leaders of a cultural
heritage and its organization through existing institutions which reveals
their true genius. This same process had taken place when Roman
genius secured and conserved the achievement of the Greeks. In the field
of religious culture with which this volume is concerned, an unbroken
continuity had been maintained from the days of the primitive church.
Even in the minor category of Christian hymnology, the hymnal as such,
created in the fourth century, was to flourish all the way into our own
times and might have done so without any special intervention. Historically
speaking, in the ninth century and under Frankish auspices, a transformation
took place which must be attributed to the conscious effort of
Frankish churchmen who, receiving the old hymnology, restored it to formal
worship with a much larger content and a greatly diversified form.
Herein lies the fundamental contribution of Germanic genius to the <i>Later
Hymnal</i>.</p>
<p>Individual hymn writers of the Carolingian age have been named
above as far as they are known, of whom Theodulphus of Orleans, Rabanus
Maurus and Walafrid Strabo are perhaps the most notable.</p>
<p>A Goth by race, a Spaniard by birth, Theodulphus, (c. 760-c. 821), belonged
to that population dwelling north and south of the Pyrenees which
the Franks had amalgamated into their kingdom. He was learned in all
the wisdom of that age and a man of action in a sense understandable in
any age. Bishop of Orleans, courtier, officer in the administration of
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
Charlemagne, he served the church and the state with equal distinction.
Theodulphus as a poet of sacred verse is best known for his Palm Sunday
processional hymn, <i>Gloria, laus et honor tibi sit</i>, &ldquo;All glory, laud and
honor,&rdquo;<a class="fn" href="#fnx3_30" id="frx3_30">[30]</a> which he wrote during the period of his fall from royal favor
under Louis the Pious. This beautiful processional hymn, a triumph of
Carolingian verse, invested with all the attraction of legend and religious
pageantry, has been a favorite in every period of Christian history. Theodulphus
was not a member of the regular clergy and he did not, as far as
we know, write hymns for the monastic cycle. He represents the contemporary
trend which brought the hymn into new areas of worship in the
offices and ceremonies of the cathedral.</p>
<p>Rabanus Maurus, (780-856), of Germanic origin, was primarily a
theologian. His boyhood studies were completed at Fulda. As a young
man he became a pupil of Alcuin at Tours. In his maturity he returned
to Fulda reaching the climax of his career as Abbot of Fulda and later,
as Archbishop of Mainz. As a writer, Rabanus undertook to hand on,
through excerpts, the knowledge of his predecessors. He wrote commentaries
on the Bible, discussed ecclesiastical organization and discipline,
theology, liturgy and worship and the liberal arts. He made translations
into German with the collaboration of Walafrid and a Latin-German glossary
for the Scriptures. In connection with worship he became interested
in the Latin hymns which were rapidly spreading through the west. He
discussed the Psalms as hymns and then the hymns of Hilary and Ambrose,
saying of the Ambrosian hymns, how widespread had become their
prestige in his day. We know from other evidence that he was acquainted
also with the hymns of Sedulius, Columba and Bede. It seems almost certain
that he practiced the art of poetry although we are restricted to a
very small remnant of verse conceded to be his. The poems include a
number of hymns for the festivals of the seasons and of the saints, illustrating
the vogue for the classic in metrical forms. Like Theodulphus, he
wrote for processional ceremonies. The Pentecostal hymn, <i>Veni, creator
spiritus</i>, has been persistently associated with the name of Rabanus but
without adequate proof. It is a lasting hymn of the ninth century.</p>
<p>(See <a href="#h9">Illustrative Hymns, IX.</a> <i>Veni, creator spiritus</i>, &ldquo;Creator-Spirit, all-Divine.&rdquo;)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>Walafrid Strabo, (809-c. 849), was like Rabanus of Germanic origin
and like him a member of the regular clergy. At Reichenau he received
his early education and at Fulda his theological training under Rabanus.
Walafrid was drawn into the courtly circle of Louis the Pious whose son
Charles he tutored and whose wife Judith became his literary patron. His
life was one of scholarship, prosperity and contentment almost to the end
of his career. Louis had appointed him Abbot of Reichenau, a place dear
to him from boyhood. From these happy surroundings and from his garden
which he immortalized in careful and loving description, he was
ousted during the civil conflict following the death of the emperor. At the
end he was restored to Reichenau and there he died. His hymns like
those of Theodulphus and Rabanus, although few in number, were written
in the spirit of the classical revival. Some were intended for festivals
and others which will be described in connection with processional hymnody,
were written to honor royal patrons.</p>
<p>In reviewing the basic hymns of the <i>Later Hymnal</i> (see <a href="#sc13">Appendix</a>),
one finds only two of Mozarabic origin whereas nine were duplicated in
the <i>Old Hymnal</i> in Spain and Gaul. The new cycles in areas under
Frankish influence appear to diverge from the Mozarabic as they become
more diversified. At the same time, Mozarabic sources reveal a parallel
evolution of the hymnal in the Iberian peninsula. The existing manuscripts
were collated and edited in 1897 by Blume in volume twenty-seven
of the <i>Analecta Hymnica</i> under the title <i>Hymnodia Gotica</i>, comprising
312 hymns of which 210 were identified by him as Mozarabic in origin.</p>
<p>The hymns of Spain, first assembled under the auspices of Gothic
churchmen as recounted in <a href="#c3">Chapter Two</a>, continued to increase with the
encouragement and participation of Mozarabic liturgists, scholars and prelates.
The generation that supported Isidore of Seville was succeeded two
hundred years later by the group associated with Eulogius, Archbishop of
Cordova (d. 859), who fostered the old traditions under Moslem control.<a class="fn" href="#fnx3_31" id="frx3_31">[31]</a>
In spite of a ruling power alien in every aspect of culture, Christian hymnology
held its own. After the Moorish invasions, it is estimated that between
thirty and forty hymns were written, several of which contain references
to the yoke of the oppressor and petitions for its removal.<a class="fn" href="#fnx3_32" id="frx3_32">[32]</a> When
the movement toward the expulsion of the Moors had been successfully
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
initiated and the Roman Rite introduced (1089) the Mozarabic hymnals
were comparable to the finest of the continental cycles. In certain instances
the contacts between Spain and Gaul were close and direct even under
the rule of the Moslems. Theodulphus of Orleans combined the Gothic
and Carolingian trends. Alcuin was indebted to Mozarabic sources in his
reform of the Frankish rites.<a class="fn" href="#fnx3_33" id="frx3_33">[33]</a> Hymns of Mozarabic origin appeared in
other parts of western Europe and vice versa.</p>
<p>(See <a href="#h10">Illustrative Hymns, X.</a> <i>Deus immensa trinitas</i>, &ldquo;O glorious immensity.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>The possible influence of Arabian music and poetry upon the Christian
hymn has been a tempting idea and one most elusive of pursuit.
Studies of medieval Spanish music and musical instruments have failed
to demonstrate that the ecclesiastical chant in Spain was thereby affected.
Such novelties as it may have possessed have been traced to influences
similar to those which had long before affected the Ambrosian chant and
been transmitted to the west. As for the tentative assumption that Arabian
lyric poetry influenced contemporary hymn writers in Spain, the evidence
narrows to the mono-rhyme or repeated end-rhyme common to Arabian
poetry and to several Mozarabic hymns.<a class="fn" href="#fnx3_34" id="frx3_34">[34]</a> The whole subject of the Arabian
impact, highly controversial as it is, appears to be concerned with
influences, which when scrutinized, are observed to spring from cultures
prior both to Christianity and to Islam.</p>
<p>The Mozarabic Hymnal in its fully developed version possessed an
unusually large number of hymns honoring local saints. This feature must
be referred to the history of the Roman persecution in the Iberian peninsula
where the complete destruction of the Church was intended and
martyrdom was the rule. Again the Hymnal is unique in its hymns for
public occasions either of mourning and intercession in time of war, pestilence,
drought and flood or of joy, in festivals of the consecration of
bishops, the coronation of kings and thanksgiving for full harvests.</p>
<h3 id="sc12">III. <span class="sc">Characteristics</span></h3>
<p>For the most part the hymn writers of the later hymn cycles are
anonymous, like their predecessors in this field. Anonymity is then the
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
first characteristic to be noted concerning the hymnal in this period, which
makes it necessary to survey the whole as an objective achievement of the
age, not of a few individuals.</p>
<p>Next to the anonymity of its authorship, possibly the most conspicuous
feature of the new hymnal is the enlargement of each of its general
divisions, the Common and the Proper of the Season and the Common
and the Proper of Saints. The old hymn cycle, it will be recalled, comprised
thirty-four hymns as listed by Blume. The later cycle in its nucleus
numbers thirty-seven hymns of which seven are repeated from the old
cycle. In ten representative tenth century hymnals, the hymns number
from about fifty to about one hundred, many of them common to several
lists.<a class="fn" href="#fnx3_35" id="frx3_35">[35]</a></p>
<p>Not only is the total number of hymns increased but festival hymns
are multiplied, the ecclesiastical year as it was later known being fully established
in hymnology. Advent, Nativity, Epiphany, Lent, the Passion,
Easter, Ascension, Pentecost and Trinity have their own groups of hymns.
The various feasts of the Virgin and that of All Saints are honored. Among
the Apostles, Sts. Peter, John and Andrew are praised; of other biblical
saints, Sts. John the Baptist, Stephen, Paul; of the angels, St. Michael; of
martyrs, the Innocents and St. Laurence; of local saints, Sts. Martin of
Tours, Gall, Germanus, Martial, and a number of others. So stands the
record of manuscripts of the tenth century when hymnal gains had been
consolidated. The process went steadily onward as Latin hymns for the
offices continued to be written to the end of the Middle Ages. A few have
been added since the sixteenth century but, with certain exceptions, the
great body of office hymns of the medieval church was permanently established
by 1100, the date which Mearns selected as a boundary line. The
same sources enriched the present-day Roman breviary which by a paradox
of history, has preserved to modern times the representative hymns to
which the Roman liturgy of that early period was so inhospitable.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, in the interval between and including the fourth
and the eleventh centuries, the Latin hymn, considered in its literary implications
and in its liturgical usage, was founded for the ages. Attaching
to the word <i>hymn</i> its strictest sense and narrowest function, that of the
office hymn, the student perceives the great significance of this department
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
of medieval hymnology as compared with the sequence, processional and
extra-liturgical hymns of the Middle Ages. It becomes more evident that
here is the core and heart of Latin hymnody. The Church could and did
in the event, dispense with much of its medieval collection, but never with
the hymnal. Here was preserved the ethics of the Christian life, the intimacy
of the scriptural narrative, the presentment of the Christian feasts
and the praise of God and of his saints.</p>

<br />The Ninth Century Revival: Sequences</h2>
<h3 id="sc14">I. <span class="sc">Origin</span></h3>
<p>The problem presented by the origin of the sequence is perhaps the
most difficult of all those connected with the evolution of medieval hymnology.
So far the available information on the subject has never been
brought together in one place. To do so is a baffling task which has by no
means been completed here nor is that which follows either exhaustive
or conclusive. It is merely an attempt to trace the origin and early development
as far as the evidence at hand makes it possible, at the same
time referring the reader to those scholars who have investigated special
topics in detail.</p>
<p>The <i>alleluia</i> of the mass is the starting-point of the sequence. Inherited
from the synagogue and incorporated in the Byzantine rite, it was
nevertheless brought independently to Rome. The extension of the final
<i>a</i> constituted a musical phrase, called a <i>iubilus</i> or <i>iubilatio</i>. This elaborated
<i>alleluia</i> with <i>iubilus</i> is Gregorian.<a class="fn" href="#fnx4_1" id="frx4_1">[1]</a> It became necessary for the sake of
breathing, to divide the extended <i>iubilus</i> into musical phrases, each a
<i>sequentia</i> and the whole <i>sequentiae</i>. Some <i>iubili</i> however, remained single
while others were sung by two choirs with a repetition of phrases. The
next step was the composition of a text for some of the <i>iubili</i>, which text
was written below the musical notation. Finally a text was supplied for
every such melody, which resulted in the <i>sequentia cum prosa</i>.<a class="fn" href="#fnx4_2" id="frx4_2">[2]</a></p>
<p>It is one thing to note the preceding succession of steps as objective
phenomena. It is quite another to explain the origin of the idea which
transformed the <i>alleluia</i> into the larger <i>iubilus</i>. This is the most obscure
point in the musical development of the sequence, which, for lack of
manuscript evidence cannot at present be clarified. At least three hypotheses
have been offered. Arguing from the appearance of the trope, some
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
have suggested that the <i>iubilus</i> is a musical interpolation just as the
trope is a textual interpolation. This is quite possible but perhaps too
simple for an adequate solution. A much more tempting hypothesis has
appealed to a variety of scholars,&mdash;that of the introduction of Greek
melodies.<a class="fn" href="#fnx4_3" id="frx4_3">[3]</a> To these students it has seemed more than probable that the
intercourse between western Europe and the Byzantine realms in the
reign of Charlemagne constitutes a sufficient explanation for the appearance
of fresh musical themes. Again, a possibility only has been suggested.
So far manuscript evidence for the Greek melodies from which
the Gregorian <i>alleluiae</i> and their <i>iubili</i> are derived, has not appeared.
Blume, whose treatment of the subject forms the basis of this chapter, not
only questions the hypothesis of Greek melodies but he offers a third suggestion
and that tentatively; Gregory, he thinks, shortened the <i>alleluia</i>
brought over by the Greeks. When, later, a tendency was felt to elaborate
the forms of worship, the longer melodies were once more revived in the
sequence. This very interesting suggestion, if one day capable of proof,
would harmonize the Byzantine and Gregorian influences which produced
the initial extension of the final <i>a</i> of the <i>alleluia</i>.</p>
<p>For purposes of clearness a differentiation should be made between
the musical and poetical development of the sequence as soon as the
<i>sequentia cum prosa</i> is reached. Manifestly it is impossible to do so, in
any complete fashion, where words and music are so inextricably interwoven
in a common development. It is better, however, to attempt the
impossible and for the present, to ignore overlappings.<a class="fn" href="#fnx4_4" id="frx4_4">[4]</a></p>
<p>The origin of the word <i>sequentia</i> itself, in the phrase <i>sequentia cum
prosa</i> has often been discussed because of its significance in tracing the
musical development of the forms in question. To some scholars <i>sequentia</i>
means merely <i>sequela</i>, <i>i.e.</i> notes following the <i>a</i> of the <i>alleluia</i>, a simple
and tenable theory. To the great majority, however, <i>sequentia</i> is a translation
of the Greek <i>akoulouthia</i>. In fact it has been generally accepted as
such, although <i>sequentia</i> conveys the idea of continuation in the Greek
word rather than its technical meaning of a continuation specifically of
songs, etc. If this is valid, Greek influence upon the origin of the sequence
is inferred.<a class="fn" href="#fnx4_5" id="frx4_5">[5]</a> Another form of the theory of Greek influence is evident in
the suggestion that <i>sequentia</i> means <i>hirmos</i>, that is, a regular continuation
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
of tones. <i>Hirmos</i> may refer to poetry also.<a class="fn" href="#fnx4_6" id="frx4_6">[6]</a> A derivation of <i>sequentia</i> from
Greek terms, if proven, would of course, buttress the theory of Byzantine
influence upon the whole development; but the weakness of the derivation
from <i>akoulouthia</i>, for example, is its dependence upon a misunderstanding
of the Greek form of worship to which the word applies.<a class="fn" href="#fnx4_7" id="frx4_7">[7]</a> An
entirely different suggestion as to origin arises from the formula used in
the liturgy to announce the Gospel, <i>Sequentia Sancti Evangelii secundum</i>
<i>etc.</i><a class="fn" href="#fnx4_8" id="frx4_8">[8]</a> Often some practical consideration, extraneous condition or unrelated
incidental circumstance has affected liturgical change or development.
Consequently, even a slight suggestion like this provokes thought.</p>
<p>Whatever may be the correct origin of the word <i>sequentia</i> the place
of origin of the sequence is generally conceded to have been France sometime
in the eighth century. The part played by other lands in the origin
of the <i>sequentia cum prosa</i> cannot be wholly determined at present. It
must suffice to study the evidence available. It has been demonstrated how
the early French sequences have a closer tie with the <i>alleluia</i> and how the
word is sometimes retained to introduce the <i>prosae</i> which accompany the
music. There is considerable evidence supporting French priority over the
Germans in the creation of these new musical forms, the chief centers of
composition being St. Martial, Luxeuil, Fleury-sur-Loire, and Moissac, the
outstanding rival of St. Martial. An origin for the sequence in France
is independently probable due to the interest in liturgical music stimulated
by Charlemagne, who, as shown in the preceding chapter, favored
Gregorian and Byzantine innovations at the expense of Gallican forms.</p>
<p>One of the suggestions mentioned to account for the original lengthening
of the <i>alleluia</i> in the <i>iubilus</i> is connected with the trope. The word
has long been defined as a textual interpolation.<a class="fn" href="#fnx4_9" id="frx4_9">[9]</a> Gastou&eacute;, however, contends
that it was originally and primarily musical, a vocalization in the
existing chant and that it was created in the music school. The ancient
form of trope is a <i>neuma triplex</i> added to the response <i>In medio</i> <i>etc.</i> for
the Feast of St. John the Apostle, or to <i>Descendit de caelis</i> for Christmas.
This vocalism is described by Amalarius of Metz and indeed Metz may
be its place of origin. Alcuin has been named as the possible originator, a
theory strengthened by the fact that Amalarius was one of his pupils.<a class="fn" href="#fnx4_10" id="frx4_10">[10]</a> At
any rate Amalarius seems to have been the first to call the melody following
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
the <i>alleluia</i>, a <i>sequentia</i>,<a class="fn" href="#fnx4_11" id="frx4_11">[11]</a> from which it is evident that the <i>iubili</i> must
have been regarded in some other light prior to his writing. The <i>sequentia</i>
in connection with the <i>alleluia</i> may very reasonably have been considered
a trope, since vocalisms like these had already appeared elsewhere in rites
of worship, and sequences in addition to those which belong to the <i>alleluia</i>
of the mass have been found in antiphonaries. To repeat, Gastou&eacute; describes
a musical interpolation or trope originating in the music schools
of the Franks and appearing in various liturgical settings. He likens the
<i>iubilus</i> to a trope which Amalarius called a <i>sequentia</i>. The original divisions
created by the musical phrases in the <i>iubilus</i> now appear in a series,
each repeated a certain number of times with introduction and conclusion
and thus the completed sequence structure comes into being. The germ
of its formal construction, Gastou&eacute; finds in certain Gregorian sources. The
ancient <i>alleluia</i>, <i>Justus ut palma florebit</i>, shows such characteristics and
reveals the liturgical Latin origin of the sequence, its melody going back to
the <i>versus alleluiaticus</i>.</p>
<p>In spite of the evidence which would make the sequence a native
musical product of western Europe, the theory of Greek origin is still persistently
held by certain scholars. For that reason it must be considered in
greater detail. Gregory&rsquo;s adoption of Greek novelties forms the starting
point of this theory, while Charlemagne&rsquo;s well-known enthusiasm for
Greek innovations carries its proponents still further. The fact that the
original Greek melodies which are assumed to have been used in the west,
have never been produced in evidence, is not a proof of their non-existence.
An extensive study of certain sequence melodies has been made in order
to determine whether they are modeled upon Greek originals, since the
Greek names for these melodies and features of notation point to such an
origin.<a class="fn" href="#fnx4_12" id="frx4_12">[12]</a> But such names are secondary, the original and natural name
being the first phrase of the Latin words accompanying the melodies and
the Greek word a suggested title. A Greek melody, called <i>Organa</i>, for instance,
might be assumed to retain its name in Latin. The opposite is the
case for the name <i>Filia matris</i> is original and <i>Organa</i> the suggested title.</p>
<p>Regarding the argument from notation it is a matter of common
knowledge that the <i>neume</i> is native to Greek-speaking lands and may have
existed as early as the sixth century.<a class="fn" href="#fnx4_13" id="frx4_13">[13]</a> <i>Neumes</i> took firm root at St. Gall,
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
the great German center for the propagation of the sequence, so much so,
that they persisted until the twelfth century even after the invention of
the staff and in the interval were spread by teaching. Moreover, <i>neumes</i>
were written in the manner of the eastern church, <i>i.e.</i> in a straight line,
not at different levels to indicate pitch.<a class="fn" href="#fnx4_14" id="frx4_14">[14]</a> It is unfortunate that the dearth
of manuscripts showing <i>neumes</i> makes a gap in the evidence just where
support is most needed, for the earliest musical manuscripts with this notation
date from the ninth century;<a class="fn" href="#fnx4_15" id="frx4_15">[15]</a> but the assumption in favor of Greek
originals is at least strong enough to forbid its being ignored.</p>
<p>An additional circumstance which supports the theory of Greek origin
is the fact of musical parallelism in the structure of the sequence. This is
an important point of contact between the sequence and Byzantine musical
forms, although it has not been universally convincing. On the contrary,
some have traced this phenomenon of musical parallelism to one of
those extraneous conditions, affecting liturgical practice, namely, the use
of antiphonal choirs.<a class="fn" href="#fnx4_16" id="frx4_16">[16]</a></p>
<p>Nothing can be more unsatisfactory to the student who is trying to
force the sequence into any particular theory of musical origin than the
contemplation of what is actually known on this subject, for the question
seems destined to remain undecided. A better perspective may be reached
by examining the poetical development of the sequence which began with
the <i>sequentia cum prosa</i> and ended in a new form of Latin hymn for
which melodies were in turn composed.</p>
<p>The text written below the <i>alleluia</i> melody is generally accepted as
of French origin and likewise the naming of that text. As the text became
important the melody too was named so that the melody and text were differentiated
from each other, the latter as a <i>prosa</i>. It is unknown whether
the name <i>sequentia</i> instead of <i>prosa</i> was chosen deliberately as differing
from the French usage. Amalarius was apparently the first to use the word
<i>sequentia</i> in connection with the music. Later the term was destined to
supersede the name <i>prosa</i> for the poetical text.</p>
<p>We owe to Notker, whose part in creating the sequence will be considered
in greater detail below, an account of his invention of words as
an aid to memorizing the elaborate melody of the <i>alleluia</i> trope. Whether
Notker was the first to see the value of this device and to employ it, is
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
unknown.<a class="fn" href="#fnx4_17" id="frx4_17">[17]</a> As a theory of origin it has always been popular, being held by
Frere and many others. For the present it may be acknowledged that it is
a reasonable theory for, of course, only the choir leader had a musical
codex to refer to and the musical ability of the average monk was unequal
to the difficulties of memorization by ear alone. Moreover, this theory can
always be accepted with others, although it seems inadequate by itself.</p>
<p>A second explanation of origin arises from the possibility that sequence
poetry originated in the imitation of Greek hymn models. The statement
has been made definitely that sequence poetry shows the transference of
the Byzantine structure of hymnody to Latin church poetry, especially
Notker&rsquo;s.<a class="fn" href="#fnx4_18" id="frx4_18">[18]</a> With every circumstance favoring such a transfer it is amazing
that the Franks who heard so much of Greek hymns and could have translated
them into Latin and sung them to the same tunes, evidently did
nothing of the kind. Some other explanation of similarity must be found.
Metrical parallelism, which is characteristic of the Latin sequence and contemporary
Greek hymns, in Gastou&eacute;&rsquo;s opinion, can be accounted for only
by reference to Hebrew poetry as the ultimate inspiration of liturgical
poetry.<a class="fn" href="#fnx4_19" id="frx4_19">[19]</a> Thus a Byzantine theory of origin breaks down when metrical
sources are subjected to closer scrutiny. After all, the sequence is unknown
in the Byzantine ritual and therefore the Byzantine influence
could never have been direct.</p>
<p>A third theory emphasizes the metrical form of the <i>alleluia</i> melody
as the determining factor in creating a new poetical rhythm.<a class="fn" href="#fnx4_20" id="frx4_20">[20]</a> Here, the
desire to create fitting expressions of praise is not explained so much as the
form in which the praises are cast. Von Winterfeld thought that rhythmical
prose was inseparable from the liturgical music which had already
been composed, just as the Greek chorus and the Wagnerian music drama
found their complement in a dignified and sonorous prose rhythm.<a class="fn" href="#fnx4_21" id="frx4_21">[21]</a> This
theory may well be called the liturgical. It is most significant for the lyrical
movement in general since a new metrical form is created differing
from the Ambrosian meter or the revived classical meters popular among
Carolingian poets. The lyric is born again, as Meyer expresses it, in the
music of the church.<a class="fn" href="#fnx4_22" id="frx4_22">[22]</a> A poem arises consisting of a series of parallel
strophes with introduction and conclusion, a lyric counterpart to the musical
phrases of the <i>sequentia</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<h3 id="sc15">II. <span class="sc">Sequences of the German School</span></h3>
<p>The importance played by St. Gall in the development of the sequence
has given rise to the theory that it originated there. Present-day opinion,
as indicated above, concedes that sequences arose in France and that St.
Gall is not a place of origin but like St. Martial, a prominent center for
their composition and diffusion. Other centers were Metz, Murbach,
Fulda, Echternach, Krem&uuml;nster and St. Florian. Reichenau, too, was important
in music and in the spread of sequence poetry.<a class="fn" href="#fnx4_23" id="frx4_23">[23]</a></p>
<p>Notker Balbulus, (840?-912), was largely responsible for the enviable
reputation enjoyed by St. Gall. Born in Switzerland, Notker had entered
the Benedictine monastery at St. Gall as a child to be educated and there
he continued as a member of the Order until his death. A pupil and later
a teacher of the music school in the period of Louis the Pious and Louis
the German, he shared the life of the Abbey during the height of its reputation,
when its doors were open to travelers from every land and every
rank of society. Notker himself tells of the refugee from the French monastery
of Jumi&egrave;ges who brought with him his famous Antiphonary. Tradition
has it that Notker composed words to fit the forms of the <i>alleluia-iubilus</i>,
note for note, already in use in his monastery, and thus originated
the sequence, finding his inspiration, not in the Ambrosian hymns but in
the liturgy.<a class="fn" href="#fnx4_24" id="frx4_24">[24]</a> The Jumi&egrave;ges Antiphonary reached St. Gall about 860, by
which time <i>prosae</i> were already known in France. There is evidence, moreover,
from manuscripts, that texts existed before Notker&rsquo;s time in St. Gall.
He is not their first composer nor are the sequences emanating from St.
Gall necessarily all Notker&rsquo;s work. &ldquo;Notkerian&rdquo; means for sequences what
&ldquo;Ambrosian&rdquo; means for hymns.</p>
<p>The problem of the authentic Notkerian sequences was subjected to
critical study and variously solved by Schubiger in 1858, Wilmanns in
1872, and Werner in 1901. More recent students have re-examined the
evidence and expressed their critical opinions as to Notker&rsquo;s poetical and
musical prestige: Singer in 1922, Van Doren in 1925 and Clark in 1926.
Of more than 100 sequences attributed to Notker, 47 were judged to be
authentic and edited in volume 53 of the <i>Analecta Hymnica</i>. Notker&rsquo;s
ability as a musician appears to be a matter of controversy. A new review
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
of the Notkerian problem and its literature has been offered by the Swiss
scholar, Wolfram von den Steinen, together with an edition of the sequences
of the St. Gall school.<a class="fn" href="#fnx4_25" id="frx4_25">[25]</a> What scholars in general have taken away
from Notker with one hand they return with the other, for if not an originator
he is conceded to be the leading agent in introducing the sequence
into Germany and setting a standard for this type of poetry which included
from Notker&rsquo;s pen a notable group of sequences for the festivals of the
whole year. His sequence for Pentecost is representative of the achievements
of the German school.</p>
<p>(See <a href="#h11">Illustrative Hymns, XI.</a> <i>Sancti spiritus adsit nobis gratia</i>, &ldquo;The grace
of the Holy Ghost be present with us.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>It is not surprising that scholars interested in the theory of Greek influence
upon sequence poetry should seek confirmation of their views in
Notker&rsquo;s work. There is a majestic quality and a vigorous resounding
praise in these poems which has been thought a reflection of Byzantine
hymns. Reference has already been made to the Byzantine strophic system
and its probable influence upon Notker&rsquo;s poetical technique. When
one considers that the monastery of St. Gall was always a port of call for
refugees and travelers from the east and in the preceding century may
have harbored many of them, it is reasonable to suppose that Notker was
acquainted with contemporary Greek hymnody. Whatever may be the
explanation of the metrical system employed by Notker, he undoubtedly
named his melodies in such a way as to suggest a Greek identification.<a class="fn" href="#fnx4_26" id="frx4_26">[26]</a></p>
<p>There remains another line of research, which is relatively unimportant,
yet should be noted when the question of Greek influence is raised. It
has been stated that Greek words are used in Latin sequences, thereby
proving contact with Greek-speaking contemporaries on the part of their
authors, or with Greek literary sources. Whenever this test is applied to
any medieval writing produced by churchmen it should not be forgotten
that the Vulgate was the one great continuous source, inspiration and
standard of the Latin language as employed in the Middle Ages. Throughout
the period, all Latin hymns which include a narrative element or
refer in any other way to biblical statements are greatly indebted to the
Vulgate. A considerable number of Greek words, naturally, appear in the
Vulgate. Applying the criterion of Greek words to Notker&rsquo;s sequences,
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
one reaches no definitive results whatever. In the forty-one sequences attributed
to Notker by Wilmanns, some seven Greek words appear which
are not in the Vulgate.<a class="fn" href="#fnx4_27" id="frx4_27">[27]</a> If this proves anything in Notker&rsquo;s case, it is
significant only in connection with other evidence from Greek originals
which has not been advanced.</p>
<p>Having considered the separate development of the musical and poetical
aspects of the sequence, as far as they can be sundered, it remains to
view certain factors which may have affected that development but have
not as yet been stated.</p>
<p>The history of medieval music, quite apart from the creation of the
<i>iubilus</i> and the <i>sequentia</i>, should not be overlooked by the student who is
trying to understand liturgical music in this general period. Perhaps during
the eighth and certainly from the ninth century, polyphonic and harmonic
forms began to appear. New melodies for sequences were in demand
and were produced, which in turn were influenced by popular and
secular music, with an interaction of words and music taking place, sometimes
with words, sometimes with music leading the way.<a class="fn" href="#fnx4_28" id="frx4_28">[28]</a> The history
of the sequence, when complete, will owe much to the studies of medieval
music now in progress by musicologists, some of whose conclusions have
been noted above. The history of musical instruments is relevant here but
in any case it must always be remembered that the church possessed the
musical notation and was able to dominate the field.</p>
<p>If the course of secular and ecclesiastical music accompanying the
sequence remains uncertain, so are the currents of medieval religious and
secular verse in Latin still uncharted. Which is the original stream? Latin
secular poetry existed contemporary with the early sequence, the secular
form of which was known as a <i>modus</i>,<a class="fn" href="#fnx4_29" id="frx4_29">[29]</a> which, like the sequence, was
inseparable from its musical accompaniment for the minstrel both sang
and played his unrhymed lay. Some have taken the extreme point of view
of the part played by secular influence and have regarded the sequence as
a popular lyric in worship, perhaps even a <i>Volkslied</i>.<a class="fn" href="#fnx4_30" id="frx4_30">[30]</a> But the question
as to the predominance of influence whether religious or secular, remains
open.</p>
<p>The argument for influence from vernacular verse upon the sequence
is equally weak. Prior to the ninth century vernacular lyrics in the Germanic
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
tongues are so rare as to be valueless in this discussion. Celtic lyrics
from the seventh and eighth centuries are also rare. It is possible that they
were known to Celtic teachers on the continent but too much should not
be assumed from this possibility or from the fact that the oldest form of
Celtic lyric exhibits rhythmic parallelism.<a class="fn" href="#fnx4_31" id="frx4_31">[31]</a> French, Spanish and early
English vernacular lyrics appear too late to be significant in the problem
of origins. In any case, the question hinges upon metrical technique which
can be adequately explained without recourse to vernacular lyrics, which,
insofar as they do exist, may be regarded as themselves imitations of earlier
Latin forms.</p>
<p>The evidence offered by secular lyrics, Latin or vernacular, in the
early Middles Ages points to an outstanding growth from the sequence
rather than a creative source for the sequence. As a matter of fact the
sequence breaks away from the church and itself becomes secular, as the
history of poetry in the later Middle Ages bears witness.</p>
<p>The above presentation of what is known as to the origin of the sequence
can scarcely be satisfactory to the scientific historian of medieval
culture. Full of inconvenient gaps and baffling inconsistencies the evidence
remains totally inadequate. One conclusion alone may be advanced
and that tentatively; the sequence appears to have been created wholly
within the liturgy of the mass. The <i>troparium</i> or <i>tropary</i>, later the gradual
and missal contained the sequences for the annual feasts just as the <i>hymnarium</i>
or <i>hymnary</i>, later the breviary had contained the hymn cycles of the
offices.</p>
<p>The appearance of the sequence in the history of medieval hymnody
was an episode of the greatest importance not only in the evolution
of Latin religious and secular poetry but in their vernacular counterparts.
In order to understand the extraordinary popularity and wide diffusion of
the sequence it must be emphasized that it is not just another hymn, but
an ornament to the mass, individually created for each and every festival
with a particular theme in mind. The seasons of Advent, Nativity, the
Passion, Easter, Ascension, Pentecost, Trinity, the Virgin festivals of the
Nativity, Annunciation, Visitation, Purification and Assumption, the feasts
of the Apostles and other biblical Saints, the Martyrs, Confessors and Virgins
formed a great series which challenged the finest efforts of the clerical
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
poets. Herein lies the essential interest of this hymnody. The original
Latin hymn was associated with daily secular worship and then with the
canonical hours of the monastery. The sequence was associated with the
celebration of the divine sacrifice.</p>
<p>As a closing illustration for this chapter the Alleluiatic sequence has
been selected. Based upon the canticle, <i>Benedicite omnia opera</i>, and often
attributed to Notker, this superb sequence reaches a height of expression
comparable to the noblest hymns of the ninth century revival.</p>
<p>(See <a href="#h12">Illustrative Hymns, XII.</a> <i>Cantemus cuncti melodum nunc Alleluia</i>,
&ldquo;The strain upraise of joy and praise.&rdquo;)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="jr small">CHAPTER FIVE</span>
<br />Late Middle Ages: Hymns and Sequences</h2>
<p>Beginning with the twelfth century the large number of new hymns
and sequences produced point to a degree of creative activity that continued
through the High Middle Ages. A recent historian of medieval literature,
De Ghellinck, sees the religious poetry of the twelfth century rivalling
the secular, and points out that ten thousand specimens of every type of
religious verse, from 1060 to 1220, are edited in the <i>Analecta Hymnica</i>.<a class="fn" href="#fnx5_1" id="frx5_1">[1]</a>
Maurice H&eacute;lin, whose attractive volume is available in English translation,
considers the poetic product of the twelfth century the peak of Latin
poetry and &ldquo;its most original contribution to the intellectual patrimony of
the west.&rdquo;<a class="fn" href="#fnx5_2" id="frx5_2">[2]</a></p>
<p>It is easier to repeat such a statement than to present acceptably the
relevant evidence in the field with which this chapter is concerned. One
might expect a larger proportion of known authors but anonymity remains
the rule. The exceptions command recognition among the most notable
writers of hymns and sequences in any period of their production.</p>
<h3 id="sc16">I. <span class="sc">Sequences of the French School</span></h3>
<p>The sequence, originally a product of France, already perfected as
a poetical form by Notker and the German school of ecclesiastical hymn
writers, attained a greater influence and popularity under Adam of St. Victor.
In 1130 Adam entered the Augustinian Abbey of St. Victor on the
outskirts of Paris and there he remained until his death. Whether a native
of France or England is unknown. Like Notker, he followed in his poetic
themes the annual festivals. To him have been attributed more than 100
sequences which appear in the manuscripts of St. Victor. They were published
first by Leon Gautier in 1858 and in the later nineteenth century
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
were subjected to critical analysis by Misset who regarded 45 sequences
as authentic.<a class="fn" href="#fnx5_3" id="frx5_3">[3]</a> Blume, who edited the Victorine sequences in volumes 54
and 55 of the <i>Analecta Hymnica</i>, attributed 48 to Adam&rsquo;s authorship.</p>
<p>Adam&rsquo;s poetical concepts are centered in the mystical interpretation
of biblical narratives and of Christian theology as it was taught in the
schools of Paris. Hugh and Richard of St. Victor were his contemporaries
but Adam was poet as well as theologian. Praise was to him an essential
harmony of voice and life. His verse departed from the earlier prose
rhythms of the German poets and was cast in a metrical form already
popularized in the hymn. A group of rhymed trochaic lines of eight syllables
with a caesura after the fourth syllable at the end of a word,
closes with a seven syllable line. This scheme with its many variants characterizes
the work of Adam and his imitators in countless Latin and later,
vernacular lyrics. Adam&rsquo;s sequence for the Feast of St. Stephen has been
selected as illustrative of his finest work.</p>
<p>(See <a href="#h13">Illustrative Hymns, XIII.</a> <i>Heri mundus exultavit</i>, &ldquo;Yesterday with
exultation.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>To appreciate fully the function of the sequence in worship at this
time as well as its appeal to popular imagination, one should isolate a
single theme for more intimate enjoyment. For this purpose, the sequences
written for the five feasts of the Virgin are best suited. While manifold
saints were honored in the hymnology of the day, the veneration of the
Virgin reached at this time, its pinnacle of expression. Notker had provided
sequences for her Nativity, Purification and Assumption. Adam of
St. Victor, poet of the Virgin, drew upon all the resources of medieval
symbolism in his <i>Salve, redemptoris mater</i>, &ldquo;Hail, mother of the Redeemer,&rdquo;
a masterpiece of medieval religious verse. Clerical poets everywhere
met the challenge of his example. The result was indicative not only
of their devotion and their poetic skill which was at times indifferent, but
of the actual use of the Virgin sequences in the numerous feasts which
honored her and their familiarity to wide congregations of clergy and
laity.</p>
<p>During this period great sequence writers appeared, some known and
distinguished, the majority anonymous. To the latter group belongs the
author of the Easter sequence, <i>Victimae paschali laudes</i>, &ldquo;Christians, to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
Paschal Victim,&rdquo; which represents the transition between the Notkerian
and Victorine styles. The growing relationship between Latin hymnology
and the arts becomes obvious in this sequence which was of importance
in building the liturgical drama for Easter. The dialogue embedded in
the poem,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Speak, Mary, declaring</p>
<p class="t0">What thou sawest wayfaring?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>and her reply, ending</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Yea, Christ my hope is arisen:</p>
<p class="t0">To Galilee he goes before you.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>contributed, with other sources, to the fully developed Easter Play.</p>
<p>The so-called Golden Sequence for Pentecost, <i>Veni sancte spiritus</i>,
&ldquo;Come, thou Holy Spirit, come,&rdquo;<a class="fn" href="#fnx5_4" id="frx5_4">[4]</a> also of undetermined authorship, attained
perhaps the greatest prestige, having now been heard in Christian
worship for more than eight hundred years.</p>
<p>The activities of the French school are largely responsible for the
popularity of sequences in the twelfth century and for their multiplication
in every part of western Europe. Other factors played a part. Just as
the Latin hymn can best be understood in the historical setting of the late
Roman Empire or of the early Germanic kingdoms, so the development of
the sequence must be interpreted in connection with the social and cultural
environment of the age. The universities, notably that of Paris, were
dominating intellectual life. Economic opportunity offered by the revival
and expansion of craftsmanship, commerce, urban life and geographical
knowledge resembled the achievement of Roman days. The European
centralized states had emerged and were assuming the national features
which mark them today. The modern languages of Europe were highly
developed in their literary treasures and in everyday speech. Under reforming
popes such as Innocent III, the church was entering an era of
unity and spiritual renewal. Side by side with the reformed Benedictine
Order, the Augustinian canons with their ancient prestige, the Franciscan,
Dominican and other religious orders were taking their part in the work
for the regeneration of society and the triumph of the Faith. Pilgrimages
and crusades were in vogue for two hundred years from 1095. The hymnody
of the church took on new vitality in an era of European awakening.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<h3 id="sc17">II. <span class="sc">Later Hymns</span></h3>
<p>Although the sequence had apparently occupied the center of attention,
the writing of office and festival hymns had never been interrupted
and certainly had never ceased. Gathering up the sources after the period
of ninth century influence described in <a href="#c4">Chapter Three</a>, one pauses at the
verse of Peter Damian, (988-1072), Cardinal Bishop of Ostia and Superior
of the monks of the Holy Cross. His theme was the joys of paradise in
the hymn <i>Ad perennis vitae fontem</i>, &ldquo;To the fount of life eternal,&rdquo; a topic
about which a distinguished hymnody was ultimately created.</p>
<p>(See <a href="#h14">Illustrative Hymns, XIV.</a> <i>Ad perennis vitae fontem</i>, &ldquo;To the fount
of life eternal.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>Fulbert, Bishop of Chartres (d. 1028), is best known for his Easter
hymn, <i>Chorus novae Ierusalem</i>, &ldquo;The chorus of the New Jerusalem,&rdquo;<a class="fn" href="#fnx5_5" id="frx5_5">[5]</a> in
which the militant ideal in its knightly form finds expression as the warriors
of the faith acclaim the victory of their royal and divine leader.</p>
<p>In the twelfth century, a complete new hymnary in all its parts was
written by Abelard, (1079-1142), for the Convent of the Paraclete of which
Heloise was the abbess.<a class="fn" href="#fnx5_6" id="frx5_6">[6]</a> A collection of 91 hymns, it has never been
highly praised by critics, yet it has provided the hymn, <i>O quanta qualia</i>,
&ldquo;How mighty are the Sabbaths,&rdquo; in praise of the Sabbath and the Good
Friday hymn, <i>Solus ad victimam procedis, Domine</i>, &ldquo;Alone to sacrifice
Thou goest, Lord,&rdquo; both of which have found a place in recent hymnals.
Helen Waddell&rsquo;s translations of the two illustrate modern renderings at
their best. The same century saw the achievement of Bernard of Cluny or
Morlaix, (fl. 1122), whose long poem, <i>De contemptu mundi</i> furnished the
selections on the heavenly country, <i>Hora novissima</i>, popularized by the
translations of John Mason Neale. Perhaps the best-known of these, <i>Urbs
Sion aurea</i>, &ldquo;Jerusalem the Golden,&rdquo; in its English rendering has attained
a vernacular status independently of its Latin original. The great anonymous
hymn, <i>Jesu dulcis memoria</i>, &ldquo;Jesu, the very thought of Thee,&rdquo; is also
of the twelfth century. Its authorship has been variously ascribed but never
certainly determined.</p>
<p>The thirteenth century was marked by the rise of hymn writing in
the new religious orders founded by St. Francis of Assisi and St. Dominic.
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
The Franciscan Bonaventura (1221-74), wrote <i>Recordare sanctae crucis</i>,
&ldquo;Be mindful of the Holy Cross,&rdquo; on the theme of the Cross. To read this
hymn side by side with the <i>Vexilla regis prodeunt</i> of Fortunatus, is to
apprehend more fully the increasing subjectivity of the Latin hymn in
500 years of its history. The passion of Christ is, moreover, a favorite
theme and object of devotion of the friars, ever present to their thinking.
Thomas Aquinas, (1227-74), greatest of the Dominicans, wrote the hymns
for the Feast of Corpus Christi, established by Pope Urban IV in 1265.
Of these, <i>Pange lingua, gloriosi corporis mysterium</i>, &ldquo;Sing my tongue,
the Saviour&rsquo;s glory,&rdquo;<a class="fn" href="#fnx5_7" id="frx5_7">[7]</a> modeled after the form of the <i>Pange lingua</i> of
Fortunatus, is in its subject matter a poetic version of the mystical subtleties
implicit in the dogma of the feast. John Peckham, Archbishop of
Canterbury, (1240-92), wrote <i>Ave vivens hostia</i>, &ldquo;Hail, true Victim,&rdquo; a
fine hymn upon the same theme which suggests the inspiration of Aquinas.</p>
<h3 id="sc18">III. <span class="sc">Later Sequences</span></h3>
<p>From the sequences of the later Middle Ages only a few have gained
eminence but in certain cases as high a place as any in the whole range
of their composition. Thomas Aquinas shows himself master of the sequence
as well as the hymn in his <i>Lauda Sion Salvatorem</i>, &ldquo;Praise, O Sion,
praise thy Saviour,&rdquo; a model of the Victorine technique.</p>
<p>(See <a href="#h15">Illustrative Hymns, XV.</a> <i>Lauda Sion Salvatorem</i>, &ldquo;Praise, O Sion,
praise thy Saviour.&rdquo;)</p>
<p><i>Dies irae</i>, &ldquo;Day of wrath,&rdquo; most majestic of all sequences, universally
acknowledged as the greatest achievement of Latin hymnology, was probably
written by the Franciscan Thomas of Celano. It was originally used
at Advent, later for All Souls&rsquo; Day and for requiem masses. The Judgment
theme is obviously inspired by the words of the Prophet Zephaniah (1:15)
from which the opening line <i>Dies irae, dies illa</i> is taken. A special
literature, together with a multitude of translations, has grown up around
this hymn which deserves consideration impossible here. It should be
read not only with reference to its biblical sources but with the great
Judgment portals of the medieval cathedrals in mind, since the sculpture
and literature of the age here find a meeting place.<a class="fn" href="#fnx5_8" id="frx5_8">[8]</a> No less significant
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
for its interpretation is the prevalence of the Black Death in the ages which
produced it.<a class="fn" href="#fnx5_9" id="frx5_9">[9]</a> The thought of a period in which pain and death were so
tragically familiar and before which the medieval man stood helpless, is
faithfully reflected in contemporary hymns.</p>
<p>The lament in its poetic form is associated with the Marian hymnology
of the fourteenth century. The <i>Stabat mater dolorosa</i>, &ldquo;By the
Cross her vigil keeping,&rdquo;<a class="fn" href="#fnx5_10" id="frx5_10">[10]</a> its finest expression, like the <i>Dies irae</i>, needs
little comment in these pages.</p>
<p>(See <a href="#h16">Illustrative Hymns, XVI.</a> <i>Stabat mater dolorosa</i>, &ldquo;By the Cross her
vigil keeping.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>In this period it seems, at least to the present writer, that the Italian-born
poets of the religious lyric come into their rightful heritage. The poets
of England and of the French, German and Spanish-speaking lands had
at one time or another held the palm in the field of hymnody. At the
very moment, so to speak, when the genius of Dante and Petrarch had
established the fame of Italian letters, the Christian hymn found new
spokesmen in a literary medium which had originated in the same
environment a thousand years before.</p>
<p>What has already been said of the multiplication of new feasts as
the medieval ages progressed, is true in an even greater degree in the later
centuries. The Feast of Corpus Christi is only one of many which marked
this period of religious devotion, and incidentally required new sequences.
If the collection of liturgical proses edited by Daniel in his <i>Thesaurus
Hymnologicus</i> and reprinted in volumes 54 and 55 of the <i>Analecta Hymnica</i>
be accepted as a guide, the new demands become clear. From the
period of Adam of St. Victor, 174 feasts were furnished with sequences,
many times over in the case of the more important festivals. The actual
liturgical collections from which the <i>Analecta Hymnica</i> was compiled constitute
a more specific source of information. If the attention of the student
is fixed upon the sequences used in well-known missals and troparies
from the thirteenth century and later, in the leading ecclesiastical centers
of Europe, a wealth of material is revealed. Many of these sequences in
the great collections are unfamiliar to the modern student, some have
never been translated into English, but as a whole they are truly representative
of this body of poetry in the period of its greatest interest. A
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
tropary of St. Martial of the thirteenth century contains an anonymous
Easter sequence, <i>Morte Christi celebrata</i> (<i>A. H.</i> 8. 33), &ldquo;Christ&rsquo;s passion
now is o&rsquo;er,&rdquo;<a class="fn" href="#fnx5_11" id="frx5_11">[11]</a> which bears comparison with the better-known sequences
which have been named above.</p>
<h3 id="sc19">IV. <span class="sc">Liturgical Collections</span></h3>
<p>To determine the actual usage of the hymn or sequence rather than
its mere existence as a specimen of religious verse, the liturgical collection
is indispensable. The old hymnaries and psalters and other books used
in the offices were examined by liturgists of the period who compiled the
breviaries of the later Middle Ages. Working under episcopal or monastic
authority they subjected the hymnic material at their disposal to a selective
process which necessarily discarded many hymns in favor of those
rendered sacred by their inclusion in the old cycles, or of hymns of recognized
merit. The Mozarabic Breviary had been compiled and its hymns
determined by this process in an earlier century. After the re-conquest
of the Spanish peninsula and the introduction of the Roman Rite in 1089,
a version of the Roman Breviary was introduced. Episcopal centers in
England, such as Hereford, York and primarily Salisbury, compiled their
service books and developed them continuously to the close of the Middle
Ages. The process was repeated throughout Christian Europe.</p>
<p>From the troparies and local collections of sequences the selections
for the gradual and missal were made, just as the hymns had been for
the breviary. These liturgical sources offer to the modern student the
range of medieval hymnody at its best. The episcopal rites are, perhaps,
more official and authoritative in their selection of hymns and sequences
but the monastic rites often reveal the legends of local saints or the more
intimate flavor of traditional piety. It should be understood that in countries
where the Roman Rite prevailed there was no departure from its
authority in the matter of hymnody. At the same time the greatest latitude
was observable. A fine illustration is provided by the books of the
Rite of Salisbury, England, or the Sarum Rite, which were compiled and
developed by great liturgists from the time of Bishop Osmund in the
eleventh century to the close of the Middle Ages. The Sarum Breviary
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
contains 119 hymns, 25 of which were written after 1100 and the Missal
contains 101 sequences, 54 of which were written about 1100.<a class="fn" href="#fnx5_12" id="frx5_12">[12]</a> The figures
are revealing in the case of hymns, of the influence of the older cycles
and in the case of sequences, of the multiplication of feasts in the later
centuries of the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>The Processional book as a bearer of hymns will be treated in the
following chapter. It remains here, to mention the Books of Hours or
medieval Primers which also contained their quota of hymns. The <i>Horae</i>
may be defined as a series of devotions, at first additional to the Seven
Hours of the daily office but in the twelfth century elaborated in a separate
book. Specifically the additions consisted of the penitential psalms, the
Office of the Dead, the Cursus of All Saints, that of the Holy Cross, and
that of the Blessed Virgin. Even before its separation from the Canonical
Hours, the Cursus of the Blessed Virgin had assumed an importance
which gave to the new collection its characteristic title of <i>Horae</i> or <i>Hours
of the Blessed Virgin Mary</i>. In the fourteenth century the single volume
came to be known in England as <i>Primarius Liber</i> or <i>Primarium</i> from
which the more familiar name Prymer or Primer is derived.<a class="fn" href="#fnx5_13" id="frx5_13">[13]</a> Its popularity
may be judged by the fact that 265 printed editions were later
known in England and 1582 on the continent.<a class="fn" href="#fnx5_14" id="frx5_14">[14]</a> Hymns are interspersed
throughout the <i>Horae</i>. In the York Hours there are eighteen hymns and
sequences of varied periods of which thirteen are centered in devotion to
the Virgin.<a class="fn" href="#fnx5_15" id="frx5_15">[15]</a> In other words, the hymns which were chosen for these
books of popular devotion are representative of later medieval favorites
in hymnody, indicating to what extent the older hymns were known
and loved and to what extent later poems had been accepted by lay folk as
well as clergy. The <i>Horae</i> are primarily valuable as a source for the later
Marian hymns upon the themes of the Joys and of the Sorrows of the
Virgin. The appearance of the beloved <i>Stabat mater dolorosa</i>, without
doubt the finest expression of the poetry of sorrow, bears witness to the
discriminative process by which the <i>Horae</i> were compiled. It seems remarkable
that the liturgists of the later period, in which the Latin hymn
was beginning to show signs of deterioration, were able to skirt as successfully
as they did, the limits of trashy sentimentality and worse poetry
which were passing current under the name of hymnody.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>To those who are interested in the relations between literature and
the fine arts an examination of the Virgin hymns, as of the <i>Dies irae</i>, will
yield similar interrelations. The hymns which were written from the
twelfth century onwards upon the Virgin theme may be closely correlated
with the sculptured forms which portray the Mother apart from the Son
in her Sorrows and more particularly in her Joys, laden with her distinctive
honors and regnant as the Queen of Heaven.</p>
<h3 id="sc20">V. <span class="sc">Influences affecting Hymnody</span></h3>
<p>Once the typical hymns and sequences of the later period have been
reviewed, it remains to trace the influences operating from the contemporary
environment upon their evolution. The problem of possible influence
of an ultimately oriental origin has already arisen in connection with
earlier hymns. It has been considered in the relation of Byzantine culture
to the origin of the sequence, and also in the form of Arabian influence
upon the Mozarabic hymnody. In both fields the evidence is tenuous and
especially in the latter where the imprint of Arabian cultural forms would
seem to be most probable. In the centuries which produced the troubadours,
the problem takes the form of a possible indirect influence from
Arabian origins through the Proven&ccedil;al singers upon the evolution of the
sequence.<a class="fn" href="#fnx5_16" id="frx5_16">[16]</a> It is true that the twelfth and thirteenth centuries boasted at
least four hundred troubadours whose poetry is extant. The names of
others are known but not their poems. As the popularity of their songs
is unquestioned, an appreciable affect upon religious lyrics might be presumed.
Granted that the influence of Arabian poetry may be demonstrated
upon the metrical aspects of troubadour lyrics, it must still be
demonstrated that the impact of the latter was felt upon the Latin hymn.
Future studies may throw light upon these problems of medieval literature
where obscurity now prevails. Metrical similarities undoubtedly exist
between Arabian and Latin verse, as already illustrated in the field of
late Mozarabic hymns. Perhaps the most convincing evidence, aside from
these, is found in processional hymns, the subject of a later chapter.</p>
<p>Much more obvious and one distinctly to be traced is the all-pervading
influence of the new religious orders upon medieval society and culture
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
in general. Hymn writers belonging, as cited above, to the Franciscan,
Dominican and other orders of friars, to say nothing of the Cistercians,
played a leading role among contemporary poets; their names and themes
have already been mentioned. Many others must be numbered with the
anonymous majority. The veneration of the Virgin reflected so faithfully
in contemporary hymns may be largely attributed to their devotion. As
itinerant preachers, moreover, the friars translated hymns into the vernacular
and brought them directly to their hearers, thus imparting the lessons
of faith and morals.<a class="fn" href="#fnx5_17" id="frx5_17">[17]</a> It might be asserted, at least tentatively, that the
friars were responsible for one of the earliest attempts to bridge the gap
between the ritual and the popular use of hymns.</p>
<p>A less tangible influence was at work emanating from schoolmen.
This was the age of the universities in which thousands of students were
pursuing the studies of theology, law and medicine. Early theological
discussion in the schools of Paris, prior to the founding of the universities,
is implicit in the sequences of Adam of St. Victor. Later, Thomas Aquinas,
Professor of Theology at the University of Paris, created a poetical counterpart
in his hymns, to the prose exposition of dogma. No one else reached
his stature in this particular but hundreds of European clerics having
theological degrees or a partial preparation for them, were active in the
church and in secular life. It is only fair to suppose that they must be
included in the great anonymous group which assisted in making that
unique contribution to medieval literature which was preserved in contemporary
liturgical collections. Without the university-trained cleric how
is it explicable that in the very age in which the vernacular languages
came to their full development in speech and in literature, Latin religious
verse was at a peak of expression? In the High Middle Ages the alumni
of the great universities were influential in every phase of society. It is
conceivable, if not demonstrable, that the clerics among their ranks played
an important although hitherto unrecognized role in the evolution of
Latin hymnody.</p>
<p>Contemporary pilgrimages take the student far afield from the centers
of learning. The crusading enterprise of two centuries which carried the
knightly companies of Europe and their entourage to the East was a
pilgrimage of continental proportions. Local shrines favored by pilgrims
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
abounded in the West from Canterbury and Walsingham to Campostella.
What effect, if any, had this wave of religious zeal or of adventurous self-seeking
upon the hymnology of the age? We know that the familiar Latin
hymns of the breviary were sung by the clerics who conducted the services
of religion in the crusading armies. We possess the texts of a variety of
vernacular hymns and songs heard among the wandering bands who
traversed the highways of Europe or traveled by sea to distant shrines.
We are told of the singing of Latin hymns at the destination of pilgrimage
but their texts are rare. A formal collection of Latin hymns associated
with the shrine of St. James of Campostella, the <i>Carmina Campostellana</i>,
has been edited in the seventeenth volume of the <i>Analecta Hymnica</i>. As
might be supposed, they voice the praises of St. James, <i>Ad honorem regis
summi</i>, &ldquo;To the honor of the King,&rdquo; (<i>A. H.</i> 17. 210) being a favorite in
both Latin and vernacular versions.<a class="fn" href="#fnx5_18" id="frx5_18">[18]</a> As a matter of fact, the hymnody
of pilgrimage must have been largely patronal, a conclusion supported
by existing Latin texts. Unfortunately we possess no great body of Latin
hymns arising from the religious impulse which animated the crusader
or the devotee of local shrines. It is possible, however, that the multiplication
of hymns for saints at this time may be attributed in part to the
multiplication of shrines of pilgrimage. If true, an influence is seen at
work, which, from the time when Ambrose built a church in Milan to
receive the relics of St. Gervasius and St. Protasius and wrote a hymn in
their honor, never ceased to operate in the intervening centuries.<a class="fn" href="#fnx5_19" id="frx5_19">[19]</a></p>
<p>With the pilgrim we come face to face with the layman and are once
more confronted with the question of lay participation in the singing of
Latin hymns, which hinges upon the further question of the degree to
which the layman could sing or even understand the Latin hymn, from
the twelfth century onward. The pious injunctions of Alexander of Hales
and Henricus de Gorichen (15th C.) to sing hymns, merely repeat a
dictum of St. Apollonius regarding the observance of the Lord&rsquo;s Day in
the second century and must not be taken too seriously by the modern
student.<a class="fn" href="#fnx5_20" id="frx5_20">[20]</a> It is indeed slight evidence for the singing of Latin hymns
by the laity. The problem is in reality linguistic and revolves about the
question of who was acquainted with Latin at this time. Setting aside the
clergy in their numerous ranks, who are often said to have had the complete
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
monopoly of the hymn in an age when congregational singing was
unknown, one must consider the remaining classes of society from the
point of view of contemporary education.</p>
<p>Beginning with the university it should be recalled that the text books
and other sources of information were in Latin and that Latin was the
medium of instruction. In this respect the aspirant for a degree in law or
medicine was on a par with the would-be clergyman. Many students took
degrees in two and occasionally in all three disciplines, and the majority
were destined for the church if only in minor orders. On the other hand,
it is certain that, as in our own day, a large number of students never
attained any degree although they had the Latin qualification. In any
case, the lay alumnus or former student of the universities, with a Latin
training, was a familiar figure in secular affairs.</p>
<p>The degree and extent of elementary and secondary education upon
which the university instruction was necessarily founded, have been the
subject of several recent studies. It seems certain that schools for children
and youth existed from the ninth century onward in cathedral and other
centers and that, as Lynn Thorndike says, &ldquo;in the period of developed
medieval culture elementary education was fairly wide-spread and general.&rdquo;<a class="fn" href="#fnx5_21" id="frx5_21">[21]</a>
Without entering into the details of this program, illuminating
as they are, we note that the curriculum was founded upon the Latin
language and Latin studies. The contemporary growth of towns involved
an expansion of education which was marked by the appearance of schools
sponsored by municipal authority. The Latin school flourished everywhere.
There is evidence that every social class participated to some extent
in the new education although illiteracy must at the same time have been
common. It seems clear that the layman who had received these early
educational advantages could understand Latin hymns or read them if
the texts were available. Both sexes shared elementary education and
lay women as well as nuns occasionally had access to advanced instruction.
Such considerations as the above presuppose a degree of familiarity
especially with the breviary hymns, on the part of laymen, even if singing
or chanting was restricted to the choirs and clergy.</p>
<p>The university movement was accompanied by the rise of the wandering
scholars and poets whose verses, for example, from the <i>Carmina
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
Burana</i>, are familiar today in translation. Popular entertainers, they sang
their Latin lyrics at ale house doors and in the market places. They must
have been at least partially understood by the populace. Other municipal
entertainment was provided by the religious drama of the times which
made considerable demand upon the Latin resources of the spectator who
had to be somewhat bilingual if he were to enjoy the public presentation
of the mystery plays.</p>
<p>Again, the bilingual or macaronic poetry which sprang up in the
period of rivalry between Latin and the vernacular may be viewed both
as a means and a result of understanding Latin hymns. Macaronic verse
was both secular and religious in its forms, favorite phrases from well-known
Latin hymns often being combined with the vernacular tongue.
The practice might even have spread to the ritual of the Church had it
not been forbidden by ecclesiastical decree.<a class="fn" href="#fnx5_22" id="frx5_22">[22]</a> The <i>cantio</i> of the later
medieval centuries and the familiar carol offer a wealth of evidence that
macaronic religious verse was extremely popular. Indeed, this may have
been the earliest manifestation of actual hymn singing on the part of
medieval laymen.</p>
<p>Even if congregational singing was not practiced, the use of Latin
hymns in private devotion is well authenticated. The <i>Horae</i> which were
included in the liturgical collections listed above, were circulated among
laymen from the fourteenth century onward, and often used as text books
or Primers from which children were taught to read. The variant title,
<i>Lay Folks Prayer Book</i>, also bespeaks its popular availability.</p>
<p>While it would be unsound to infer a universal knowledge of Latin
hymnody among the laity of Europe upon any or all of the evidence here
assembled, it is logical to suppose that this treasury of verse lay within
the boundaries of average education and cultural ability. Combined with
the effectiveness of visual means of conveying religious truths through
architecture, sculpture and stained glass, popular acquaintance with the
teachings of Christian hymnody must be supposed to have overflowed
the limits of clerical restriction, if indeed, any such existed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<h3 id="sc21">VI. <span class="sc">Characteristics</span></h3>
<p>To close this somewhat rambling account of the Latin hymn and sequence
in the later medieval centuries, which is necessarily discursive even
as the civilization itself was everywhere expanding, the characteristics of
this poetry should be reviewed in comparison with those of earlier Latin
hymns.</p>
<p>An increasing variety of subject matter is first to be noted, to accompany
the diversification of worship brought about by new feasts and the
appearance of new religious agencies. Hymns for the festivals of saints
provide the best illustrations of this tendency which has been amply
treated above.</p>
<p>A marked trend toward the compilation of local liturgical collections
and the differentiation of service books accompanies the unification of
rites in various European lands. This tendency was observed in earlier
centuries, particularly in Spain where the Mozarabic hymnal prevailed.
St. Gall had provided a monastic center of influence in German-speaking
lands in its day. Now, the great diocesan and monastic centers, on a
much larger scale, are furnished with a full complement of ritual books
and guides to hymnody. In England, the Sarum collection achieved great
prominence, acquiring national rather than diocesan proportions.</p>
<p>Within the hymnic poetry itself changes are seen both in form and
spirit. A full development of metrical forms takes place, some of which
had appeared much earlier in isolated examples and were now widely
accepted; others were characteristic of late medieval literary art. The meters
and rhythm of sequence poetry were popularly favored. Subjective qualities
and attitudes which had been infrequent in the earlier hymns devoted
to biblical themes and theological expression are much more obvious in
later hymns. The personal petition and the direct address to deity and
the saints are frequent. It has been suggested above in considering hymns
upon the theme of the Cross, that a comparison of hymns from the earlier
and later groups is instructive. But any of the great themes may be
selected for this purpose, for example, the Pentecostal theme, with a group
of hymns in which the earlier ones are simple narratives following the
biblical account of the descent of the Holy Spirit; the later ones are
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
exemplified by <i>Veni, sancte spiritus</i>, &ldquo;Come, Thou Holy Spirit, come,&rdquo;
already cited, in which the Spirit is addressed and invoked for personal
blessings and the sevenfold gifts.</p>
<p>With the waning of the medieval centuries came a characteristic
decadence in the poetical quality of Latin hymns and in their spiritual
vitality. This was true of the sequence and most obvious, perhaps, in
those which were devoted to the praise of the saints. Reference to this
phenomenon will be made in a later chapter in connection with the
possible reason for the loss of religious significance which must be admitted
although deplored by students of the subject.</p>
<p>Finally, one observes that certain hymns of these later centuries
rival, if not surpass, the representative hymns of the first half of the
Middle Ages. Four of the five sequences retained in the present-day
Roman Missal were all selected from this group, namely: <i>Lauda Sion
Salvatorem</i>, <i>Veni sancte spiritus</i>, <i>Dies irae</i>, and <i>Stabat mater dolorosa</i>.
Other illustrative hymns and sequences mentioned above prove to be
almost as familiar.</p>
<p>On the contrary, decadent hymns have tended to disappear. Unworthy
of their theme and purpose, a multitude of examples may be unearthed
from their present burial places in the <i>Analecta Hymnica</i> or other
collections by the curious investigator. So far as actual usage is concerned
they have been gradually discarded and forgotten in the process
of time. Similarly those of greater merit have possessed a survival value
sufficient to insure recognition in every succeeding century.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="jr small">CHAPTER SIX</span>
<br />Late Middle Ages: Processional Hymns</h2>
<h3 id="sc22">I. <span class="sc">Origins</span></h3>
<p>The procession as a practice of the Christian Church originates in
the triumphal entry of Jesus into Jerusalem. All four evangelists record
the event and all four make mention of the hosannas and acclamations of
the people which accompanied it.<a class="fn" href="#fnx6_1" id="frx6_1">[1]</a> True, the procession is older than Christianity
and wider in observance. It seems to be a natural impulse of
humanity in all ages and in all lands to make orderly progress from one
place to another for the expression of communal joy or lamentation or to
seek the aid and blessing of supernatural power in the activities and
vicissitudes of life.</p>
<p>Processional ceremonies as they were observed in ancient oriental
civilizations or in the culture of Greece and Rome are not considered here,
except as they may have affected Christian origins. The purpose of this
chapter is to describe the background and setting of processional forms
which, in their evolution, gave rise to a continuity of hymns; to trace the
origin, development and distinguishing features of such processional
hymns in the Middle Ages and to display processional hymnody in its
distinctive character as a separate category of medieval Latin hymnology.</p>
<p>Prior to the fourth century the record is obscure. Miscellaneous
notices begin to appear in the last quarter of the century. Basil notes a
procession in the form of a litany (c. 375). Ambrose mentions a procession
of monks (c. 388) and also refers to a procession in Rome honoring
Sts. Peter and Paul, in his hymn, <i>Apostolorum passio</i>, &ldquo;The passion
of the Apostles,&rdquo; (A. H. 50. 17). Chrysostom was active in organizing
processions in Constantinople to offset Arian influence (390-400).<a class="fn" href="#fnx6_2" id="frx6_2">[2]</a> At the
same period, 379-388, Aetheria (St. Sylvia of Aquitania?) made her
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
pilgrimage to the holy places of Palestine, describing in her journal in
detail, the ceremonies enacted in the worship of the Christian Church
at Jerusalem.<a class="fn" href="#fnx6_3" id="frx6_3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Remarkable in all respects, Aetheria&rsquo;s narrative is obviously written
in a spirit of devotion with eager curiosity and joyful appreciation. She
describes, among other observances, the Hour services, especially the
<i>lucernare</i> when hymns were sung, the Sunday procession to the Anastasis
or Church of the Resurrection which marked the tomb of Jesus and the
procession and rites for the Feasts of the Epiphany, Ypapanti or Presentation
of Christ in the temple, Palm Sunday and Easter.<a class="fn" href="#fnx6_4" id="frx6_4">[4]</a> Hymns in which
the laity as well as the clergy participated are mentioned in connection
with these ceremonies but no specific hymn is named. The immediate
purpose of the processions at Jerusalem appears to have been the enactment
of scenes in the life of Jesus in the places where they occurred,
introducing a dramatic element which pervades medieval processional
observances throughout their history.</p>
<p>Aetheria uses the words psalm, antiphon and hymn in connection
with the musical parts of the worship she observed, but not indiscriminately.
She was probably familiar with hymns as they had developed in
the fourth century both in the eastern and western churches. It has been
assumed that the hymn sung at the daily lighting of the candles was <i>Phos
hilaron</i>, &ldquo;O gladsome light.&rdquo;<a class="fn" href="#fnx6_5" id="frx6_5">[5]</a> The hymns she heard at the Good Friday
observance have been tentatively identified as the <i>Idiomela</i> for Good Friday,
traditional in Byzantine ritual.<a class="fn" href="#fnx6_6" id="frx6_6">[6]</a> In any case they were true hymns,
perhaps of a metrical, or more probably of a rhythmical type. It is impossible
to identify the processional hymns of which she speaks. All that can
be asserted is that non-scriptural, as well as scriptural hymns, were sung
in the processions at Jerusalem.</p>
<p>In Constantinople, contemporary processions have already been mentioned.
The practice of Jerusalem was also adopted there. In the sixth century
under Justinian, the Feast of Ypapanti was introduced.<a class="fn" href="#fnx6_7" id="frx6_7">[7]</a> However,
the history of Byzantine processions must be omitted from this study which
is devoted primarily to the Latin West.</p>
<p>In Rome, the Christian procession had an independent origin, being
derived in part from the memorial honors paid to the Christian martyrs
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
and in part from the Christianization of pagan ceremonies. When the
period of persecution of Christianity had come to a close and the triumphant
Church was able to assert publicly her influence and authority at
Rome, processions were made as early as the fifth century to the places
where martyrs had suffered. This is the origin of the later station procession,
followed by the celebration of mass in the various churches where
the remains of martyrs removed from the catacombs were buried. A century
earlier in Milan, Ambrose had discovered and removed the bodies
of St. Protasius and of St. Gervasius from their original burial place to a
church newly erected in their honor.<a class="fn" href="#fnx6_8" id="frx6_8">[8]</a> Pope Gregory the Great (590-604)
observed the Roman stations and Pope Sergius (687-701) completed
their organization.<a class="fn" href="#fnx6_9" id="frx6_9">[9]</a> The processions were accompanied by the
chanting of psalms but there is no record of non-scriptural hymns. The
symbolism of the procession, however, was enriched by the idea of pilgrimage
to a spot made sacred by martyrdom, a continuing processional
motive throughout the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>While the station processions developed in the vicinity of Rome, the
litany processions arose in Gaul. Mametus, the Bishop of Vienne, 474,
inaugurated the <i>litania minor</i> or the public blessing of the fields and crops
in the spring season. In 511, the Council of Orleans ordained the
observance for Gaul, and the Council of Girona, in 517, for Spain. The
<i>litaniae minores</i> or rogations, perpetuate in their intent, processions of the
Roman era. The <i>litaniae maiores</i> which were prescribed by Gregory the
Great, 598, and Leo III (795-816), were of similar origin and purpose.
A <i>litania septiformis</i> was also organized by Gregory on the occasion of a
pestilence at Rome.<a class="fn" href="#fnx6_10" id="frx6_10">[10]</a> The <i>litania maior</i> came to be observed on April 25,
St. Mark&rsquo;s day, and the <i>litaniae minores</i> in the three days preceding Ascension.
Psalms but not hymns in the sense of non-scriptural compositions
were heard in the litanies. The procession of supplication common
alike to pagan and Christian practice is illustrated in the litanies, a constant
motive and a constant observance in medieval rites.</p>
<p>It seems clear, therefore, that primitive Christian processions in
Rome consisted of stations and litanies. Festival processions were introduced
into the west gradually. Ascension is spoken of as an ancient feast
but there is no specific evidence of its observance before the middle of
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
the fourth century. The Ascension procession, implied by Aetheria in her
journal, is unknown in Rome at this time.<a class="fn" href="#fnx6_11" id="frx6_11">[11]</a> Pope Sergius imported into
Rome the festival procession for Candlemas or the Feast of the Purification
of the Virgin. The Feast of Ypapanti or Presentation, originally observed
in Jerusalem and later adopted in Constantinople, as noted above,
gained in the transfer a new feature. The carrying of lighted candles, not
mentioned by Aetheria, seems to have been added in Byzantine practice.
The words spoken by Simeon of the infant Jesus, &ldquo;a light to lighten the
Gentiles&rdquo; (Luke 2. 32) made the symbolic use of lights almost inevitable.
The date of the Feast of the Purification, February 2, was approximately
that of the pagan <i>Amburbium</i> or <i>Amburbale</i>, an early Roman procession
of lustration which had taken place in that month. Possibly the procession
for the Feast is reminiscent of this pagan practice.<a class="fn" href="#fnx6_12" id="frx6_12">[12]</a> It might be of interest
to follow in closer detail the origin of the medieval Candlemas, but attention
must be directed to the Candlemas hymns later to be written and
sung in procession at this Feast.</p>
<p>The period of Christian processional origins which may be considered
to close with the seventh century, saw the development of the processions
at Jerusalem, their adoption in Constantinople and the evolution
of the stations and litanies in the west. Festival processions also, were
slowly making their way into the Western Church.<a class="fn" href="#fnx6_13" id="frx6_13">[13]</a></p>
<h3 id="sc23">II. <span class="sc">Evolution in the Early Middle Ages</span></h3>
<p>That the Latin processional hymn appeared first in Gaul should surprise
no one. It has already been suggested that the hymns among the
<i>Carmina</i> of Fortunatus were created in the atmosphere of freedom enjoyed
by Gallic hymn writers in accordance with contemporary canons.
Always a poet of the occasion, Fortunatus wrote three hymns for the reception
of a relic believed to be of the true Cross, which was presented
to Rhadegunda, his patron, by the Byzantine Emperor, Justin II and his
wife Sophia, for the convent at Poitiers. As a final stage in the journey
from Constantinople, the relic was borne in procession from Mign&eacute; to
Poitiers, accompanied by Euphronius, Bishop of Tours. On this day
the hymn, <i>Vexilla regis prodeunt</i>, was first heard.<a class="fn" href="#fnx6_14" id="frx6_14">[14]</a> Two others, <i>Pange
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
lingua</i> and <i>Crux benedicta</i> (see <a href="#c2">Chapter One</a>) were devoted by Fortunatus
to the same theme of the Holy Cross, although it cannot be proved
that they were sung in the same procession.</p>
<p>The Resurrection hymn, <i>Tempora florigero rutilant distincta sereno</i>,
&ldquo;Season of luminous days, marked bright with the birth of flowers,&rdquo; (<i>Carm.</i>
3. 9), was originally written for the Easter baptismal rites celebrated by
Felix, Bishop of Nantes (d. 582). It was a poem of 110 lines or 55 elegiac
couplets, from which the cento of 28 lines beginning <i>Salve festa dies</i>,
&ldquo;Hail thee, festival day,&rdquo; was later selected for an Easter processional.<a class="fn" href="#fnx6_15" id="frx6_15">[15]</a></p>
<p>The metrical models provided by <i>Pange lingua</i> of the trochaic pattern
and <i>Salve festa dies</i>, the elegiac, continued to be employed throughout
the Middle Ages for processional hymnody, the elegiac excelling in popularity.
First in the original hymn, then in centos and finally in imitative
verse adapted to a multitude of feasts, <i>Salve festa dies</i> was never superseded
but maintained the influence of Fortunatus for centuries.</p>
<p>Spain must have known the processional hymn soon after its appearance
in Gaul, perhaps in the seventh century. Here, the Palm Sunday
festival seems to have been the source of inspiration for the procession
and blessing of palms is mentioned by Isidore of Seville as an observance
of his day.<a class="fn" href="#fnx6_16" id="frx6_16">[16]</a> Contemporary evidence indicates a similar procession in
Italy.<a class="fn" href="#fnx6_17" id="frx6_17">[17]</a> The use of a processional hymn, however, is not as clearly indicated.</p>
<p>It seems probable that the seventh century hymn, <i>Magnum salutis
gaudium</i> (<i>A. H.</i> 51. 73), &ldquo;O great joy of salvation,&rdquo; is one of the earliest
to be assigned for Palm Sunday. It is a simple rendering in the Ambrosian
style, of the events recounted in the biblical narrative.<a class="fn" href="#fnx6_18" id="frx6_18">[18]</a> In the early
centuries when the concept of a specific processional hymn for a particular
festival was almost unheard of, a familiar hymn from the old hymnals
might be used in the new ceremonies. It has been suggested that <i>Magnum
salutis gaudium</i> was known to Theodulphus, who in the ninth century
wrote the Palm Sunday processional hymn, <i>Gloria laus et honor</i>, for all
the ages.</p>
<p>Processions, thus far, have been thought of chiefly, as wholly or in
part outside the church edifice. Processions within the edifice were also
frequently observed. A procession of the clergy, in connection with which
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
psalms and antiphons were sung, preceded the Sunday high mass; another
took place as the Gospel codex was carried to its place for reading. Other
ceremonies within the church, aside from the liturgy proper, were sometimes
accompanied by hymns.<a class="fn" href="#fnx6_19" id="frx6_19">[19]</a></p>
<p>Perhaps the earliest hymn in use at a special ceremony, once more
a selection from the hymnal, was <i>Audi, iudex mortuorum</i> (<i>A. H.</i> 51. 80),
&ldquo;Hear Thou Judge of the dead,&rdquo; sung on Holy Thursday at the consecration
of the chrism.<a class="fn" href="#fnx6_20" id="frx6_20">[20]</a> The words <i>O redemptor, sume carmen temet concinentium</i>,
&ldquo;O Redeemer, accept the hymn of Thy people magnifying
Thee,&rdquo;<a class="fn" href="#fnx6_21" id="frx6_21">[21]</a> formed a refrain, a metrical feature which came to be the unmistakable
mark of the processional hymn.</p>
<p>In this early period from the sixth to the tenth century, a new idea
and a new practice came into being, the use of hymns apart from those
of the canonical hours and the sequences of the mass. The ninth century
revival of hymnody in all its branches was taking place in western Europe
just as this period came to a close, in connection with which the processional
hymn was inevitably affected as the office hymn and the sequence
had been by a fresh inspiration to poetry and worship. The movement
came to fruition at St. Gall where the musical and ceremonial aspects of
that great monastic center were so highly developed, a center which had
contributed so heavily to the Carolingian revival of literature and the
arts.</p>
<p>The French liturgical scholar, Leon Gautier, whose contributions to
the study of medieval hymnology have already been mentioned, was the
first to identify the processional hymn as a trope or liturgical interpolation.
In a study of the St. Gall processional hymns he observed that they
were classified by the name <i>versus</i> which in itself points to a separate
hymnic category. Other earlier hymns used in processions were there
called <i>versus</i>. Gautier discovered that musical notation always appeared
with the <i>versus</i>, an indication that these hymns were invariably chanted
and he noted that the <i>versus</i>, in the manner of the hymn <i>O redemptor,
sume carmen</i>, cited above, was without exception, accompanied by a refrain.<a class="fn" href="#fnx6_22" id="frx6_22">[22]</a></p>
<p>The processional hymns of St. Gall, like the sequences, bore the
characteristic marks of the hymnic group to which they belonged. From
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
this stage in their evolution they were set apart by their music, classification
and refrain.</p>
<p>The wider circle of Carolingian liturgical interest included hymn
writers other than those of St. Gall: Theodulphus of Orleans, Walafrid
Strabo of Reichenau, Rabanus Maurus of Fulda, Radbert of Corbie, who
with Waldram and Hartmann of St. Gall wrote processional hymns. The
hymns of Theodulphus and of Rabanus Maurus have been considered
above.</p>
<p>Other great festivals of the ecclesiastical year and of the saints were
now observed with processional honors for which new hymns were written;
special ceremonies also, were thus recognized. Hartmann wrote the
elegiac hymn <i>Salve, lacteolo decoratum sanguine festum</i> (<i>A. H.</i> 50. 251),
&ldquo;Hail festival, graced with the blood of the Innocents,&rdquo; for the Feast of the
Holy Innocents. The processional hymns of Rabanus Maurus were heard
at Nativity, Easter and possibly the Feast of the Purification. The dramatic
spirit, always present in the true processional is felt in all these hymns
while the refrain reiterates the message of the feast:</p>
<p>for Easter,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><span class="vn">R. </span>Surrexit quia Christus a sepulcro,</p>
<p class="t">Collaetetur homo choro angelorum. (<i>A. H.</i> 50. 190)</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Since Christ has risen from the tomb,</p>
<p class="t">Let man rejoice with the choir of angels.</p>
</div>
<p>for the Nativity,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><span class="vn">R. </span>Christo nato, rege magno</p>
<p class="t">totus orbis gaudeat. (<i>A. H.</i> 50. 186)</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Since Christ is born, the mighty king,</p>
<p class="t">let the whole earth rejoice.</p>
</div>
<p>Processional hymns for saints are represented by Radbert&rsquo;s hymn honoring
St. Gall,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><span class="vn">R. </span>Annua, sancte Dei, celebramus festa diei,</p>
<p class="t">Qua, pater, e terris sidera, Galle, petis. (<i>A. H.</i> 50. 241)</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">We celebrate, O Saint of God, our yearly feast on this day</p>
<p class="t">When thou, father Gallus, dost leave the earth for heaven.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>To celebrate the life and miracles of a patron saint was frequently the inspiration
of a medieval procession, which, in the case of St. Gall, passed
beyond the precincts of the monastery into the streets of the town.<a class="fn" href="#fnx6_23" id="frx6_23">[23]</a> It is
no wonder that the tradition of these processions, furnished with all the
splendor of festival vestments, of robed choirs, of monastic treasures and
sacred banners should have made St. Gall unique.</p>
<p>The Sunday processions were sometimes accompanied by imposing
hymns in the form of litanies. It should not be forgotten that the ancient
Christian processions were, in great part, of this nature. Waldram, Hartmann
and Radbert wrote such hymns but Hartmann&rsquo;s was evidently a
favorite, <i>Summus et omnipotens genitor, qui cuncta creasti</i>, &ldquo;Mighty and
omnipotent father, who hast created all things,&rdquo; with the refrain,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><span class="vn">R. </span>Humili prece et sincera devotione</p>
<p class="t">Ad te clamantes semper exaudi nos. (<i>A. H.</i> 50. 253)</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">With humble prayer and pure devotion,</p>
<p class="t">Ever hear us as we cry to Thee.</p>
</div>
<p>It seems probable that the custom of singing a hymn in the procession
before the reading of the Gospel originated at St. Gall. Hartmann
provided a beautiful <i>versus</i> for this purpose,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Sacrata libri dogmata</p>
<p class="t">Portantur evangelici. (<i>A. H.</i> 50. 250)</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The sacred words of the</p>
<p class="t">Gospel are borne.</p>
</div>
<p>A <i>versus</i> for the reception of the Eucharist was written by Radbert,
<i>Laudes omnipotens, ferimus tibi dona colentes</i> (<i>A. H.</i> 50. 239), &ldquo;In reverence,
Almighty, we bring our praises as gifts to Thee.&rdquo; The Blessing of the
Font on Holy Saturday inspired his <i>Versus ad Descensum fontis</i> (<i>A. H.</i>
50. 242-3). Among the ceremonies most characteristic of medieval piety
was that of <i>Mandatum</i> or foot-washing, commemorating the act of Jesus
in washing his disciples&rsquo; feet, (<i>John</i> 13; 1-15). The name &ldquo;Maundy Thursday&rdquo;
is a modern survival of the ancient terminology.<a class="fn" href="#fnx6_24" id="frx6_24">[24]</a> The hymn associated
with this rite appears first in Gaul in the eighth or ninth century
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
and may have been current in Italy in monastic centers. The antiphon,
<i>Ubi caritas et amor, Deus ibi est</i>, &ldquo;Where charity is and love, God is there,&rdquo;
is at once the motive and refrain of this hymn, <i>Congregavit nos in unum
Christi amor</i> (<i>A. H.</i> 12. 24), &ldquo;The love of Christ has united us,&rdquo; which
follows the scriptural account.<a class="fn" href="#fnx6_25" id="frx6_25">[25]</a></p>
<p>The student must turn once more to the great monastic centers of the
Germanic world for processional hymns honoring royalty. Visits of kings
and emperors to St. Gall and other noted monasteries were by no means
uncommon; that colorful processions and demonstrations of loyalty were
a part of their reception cannot be doubted. Walafrid Strabo celebrates
the visit of Lothair to Reichenau with the hymn,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><span class="vn">R. </span>Imperator magne, vivas</p>
<p class="t">semper et feliciter. (<i>A. H.</i> 50. 176)</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Live, O mighty emperor</p>
<p class="t">ever in felicity.</p>
</div>
<p>Walafrid Strabo praised Charles, son of Louis the Pious, and Radbert, the
Empress Richgard. Other processionals could be used on the occasion of the
coming of any royal visitor.</p>
<p>Vatican manuscripts offer evidence of contemporary processions in
Italy and Rome, the city of their origin. From this source is derived the
processional hymn <i>Sancta Maria, quid est?</i> (<i>A. H.</i> 23. 74), &ldquo;Sancta Maria,
what meaneth this?&rdquo; written for the procession which marked the eve of
the Feast of the Assumption, about the year 1000. Specific directions for
the route, the order of precedence and every detail of the ceremonial are
available, while the hymn itself depicts the devotion and human appeal
attending this night time scene in Rome.<a class="fn" href="#fnx6_26" id="frx6_26">[26]</a></p>
<h3 id="sc24">III. <span class="sc">Evolution in the Later Middle Ages</span></h3>
<p>For the evolution of the processional hymn from this point to the
close of the Middle Ages, we have in addition to hymnic manuscripts,
the service books and manuals devoted to, or including, processional practice.
The <i>Ritual</i> or <i>Roman Pontifical</i> was the earliest to include directions
for processions, an illustration of which has been presented above in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
case of <i>Sancta Maria, quid est?</i> In the course of time, since so many medieval
processions were not thus provided for, the <i>Processional</i> came into
existence, containing the order of processions for a particular diocese or
monastery.<a class="fn" href="#fnx6_27" id="frx6_27">[27]</a> The St. Gall <i>Processionals</i>, for instance, are informative
as to customs already described above. The specific name <i>versus</i> gave rise
to the title <i>Versarius</i> for a book of processional hymns.<a class="fn" href="#fnx6_28" id="frx6_28">[28]</a></p>
<p>In addition to the collections, liturgical writers discussed the procession.
Of these, none was more influential than Durandus, Bishop of
Mende, who, about 1286, produced his <i>Rationale divinorum officiorum</i>
which among many other liturgical subjects, included processional rites.<a class="fn" href="#fnx6_29" id="frx6_29">[29]</a>
Durandus was a leading authority upon ecclesiastical symbolism. Accordingly,
he dwells upon every minute detail of the great processions for
Easter, Ascension, Palm Sunday and the Purification as well as the Sunday
procession and others of lesser importance, ascribing to each act a
wealth of symbolic meaning. Much of this figurative interpretation is obvious
and inherent in the feast to be celebrated but in other cases he gives
full play to his sense of the symbolic, a phase of contemporary thought
already so characteristic of Adam of St. Victor and other writers on religious
themes. Finally he declares that whatever else is suggested, &ldquo;the true
procession is a progress to the celestial country.&rdquo; (<i>Ipsa vero processio, est
via ad coelestem patriam.</i>)<a class="fn" href="#fnx6_30" id="frx6_30">[30]</a> If the fundamental concepts which entered
into their origins be reviewed, medieval processions apparently carried
with them the familiar ideas of supplication, of dramatic representation
or of pilgrimage to sacred places. Durandus reiterates and sublimates these
concepts, giving them an added significance.</p>
<p>The processional manuals, especially of the English rites observed at
Salisbury, York, Canterbury and other cathedral centers, offer descriptions
and sometimes illustrations showing the order and vestments of the
clergy, the position and functions of the choir, the appropriate acts involved,
together with the complete text of the antiphons, psalms, other
scriptural passages, hymns, prayers and rubrics. Turning to the processional
hymns which were rendered in these centuries, one is impressed
by the gradual disappearance of hymns typical of the efforts of the St.
Gall school and its contemporaries. A tremendous vogue of the original
<i>Salve festa dies</i> of Fortunatus which had never been lost sight of, together
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
with its centos, variants and copies, takes possession of the field. There
were in all, perhaps, from one hundred to one hundred and fifty true processional
hymns in circulation throughout the whole medieval period, if
one enumerates those which are edited in the <i>Analecta Hymnica</i>. One
half of these may be considered to be of the <i>Salve festa dies</i> type while
similar elegiac metrical forms are found in half of the remainder.</p>
<p>What has been said of the cultural background in which the sequence
developed and multiplied is equally true for the processional hymn. The
same influences which created new seasonal feasts and additional feasts
for the saints, produced new processional hymns to accompany them.
There is, however, a great disparity between the number of sequences and
processional hymns that were written. The sequence was regnant in sacred
and secular verse, both in Latin and the vernaculars. Office hymns, too,
far outnumbered processionals. This may be another way of saying that
the office hymns and the sequences had a liturgical function and setting,
while the processional was always extra-liturgical and either superfluous
or purely ornamental from this point of view. The antiphons and psalms
were sufficient to satisfy the essential choral demands of any procession.</p>
<p>Unfortunately Thomas Aquinas did not include a processional hymn
when he furnished the hymnody for the Feast of Corpus Christi. He could
hardly have envisaged the thousands of Corpus Christi processions throughout
Catholic Christendom which have marked the Feast even to this day.
Nor could he have foreseen that his hymn <i>Pange lingua gloriosi corporis
mysterium</i>, written in the tradition of Fortunatus, would be widely appropriated
for that purpose. Other processionals for Corpus Christi appeared
almost at once, especially of the <i>Salve</i> type.</p>
<p>Contemporary devotion to the Virgin Mother and her festivals was
felt in the expansion of the Marian hymnology for processions. The establishment
of St. Osyth in Essex was a center in which new hymns were
used for the Visitation,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Salve festa dies, toto venerabilis aevo,</p>
<p class="t">Qua Christi mater visitat Elizabeth. (<i>A. H.</i> 11. 51)</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Hail thee, festival day, blest day that is hallowed forever,</p>
<p class="t">On which Christ&rsquo;s mother visits Elizabeth.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>and the Assumption,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Salve festa dies, toto venerabilis aevo,</p>
<p class="t">Qua fuit assumpta virgo Maria pia. (<i>A. H.</i> 11. 55)</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Hail thee, festival day, blest day that is hallowed forever,</p>
<p class="t">On which the holy Virgin Mary was assumed.</p>
</div>
<p>A lengthy hymn of twenty stanzas for the Feast of the Purification which
had been observed for so many centuries, appears in a twelfth or thirteenth
century manuscript from Kremsm&uuml;nster, <i>Laetetur omne saeculum</i> (<i>A. H.</i>
4. 54), &ldquo;Let every age rejoice.&rdquo; The biblical scene of the Presentation in
the Temple is described and reference is made to the carrying of lighted
candles.</p>
<p>Later medieval practice perpetuated other earlier customs. From the
original station processions at Rome had developed the ceremonies to celebrate
the translation of relics of saints in western European lands. Pope
Callistus II (d. 1124) wrote a processional hymn honoring St. James of
Campostella, <i>Versus Calixti Papae, cantandi ad processionem sancti Jacobi
in solemnitate passionis ipsius et translationis ejusdem</i> (<i>A. H.</i> 17. 194), or
<i>Versus of Pope Callistus, to be sung at the procession of St. James in the
celebration of his passion and translation</i>. A hymn for St. Kyneburga (d.
680) commemorated the restoration of her relics to their original burial
place in Peterborough Minster from which they had been removed during
the Danish invasions.<a class="fn" href="#fnx6_31" id="frx6_31">[31]</a> (<i>A. H.</i> 43. 218)</p>
<p>A procession in which the relics were carried for the veneration of
the worshipers was familiar in many places. Records from St. Gall
testify that St. Magnus was honored with such a procession and an
appropriate hymn of praise (<i>A. H.</i> 50. 261). The relics of saints treasured
at Exeter were borne in procession with the singing of a hymn which
mentions their miraculous powers. (<i>A. H.</i> 43. 277)</p>
<p>In an era marked by municipal drama and civic display as well as
religious festivals, the pageantry of the procession was understandably
popular. Rome always had its great processions. Accounts are extant of
ceremonies accompanied by hymns, in Tournai, Strasburg, Nuremberg
and other medieval towns, aside from those prescribed by episcopal and
monastic manuals of the day for the great cathedrals and abbeys.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>The music to which the processional hymn was sung is, in some
cases, available. The St. Gall manuscripts, as Gautier noted, were furnished
with musical notation. This is occasionally true of later manuscripts,
especially as we enter the closing medieval centuries. The traditional melodies
of certain hymns, like the <i>Salve festa dies</i> and <i>Gloria laus et honor</i> are
known to-day. Musicologists and students of liturgical music are currently
engaged in bringing this music to present-day knowledge. For example,
the hymn used in procession before the reading of the Gospel appears in
the twelfth and thirteenth centuries as a <i>conductus</i> or <i>conductum</i> which,
in turn, is related to the <i>cantio</i>.<a class="fn" href="#fnx6_32" id="frx6_32">[32]</a> A <i>conductus</i> for the festival of St. James
of Campostella (<i>A. H.</i> 17. 199), illustrates the evolution of a minor type
of processional hymn from Hartmann&rsquo;s solemn <i>versus</i>, mentioned above,
to the festive style of the late medieval period. The recent study of the
<i>conductus</i> by Leonard Ellinwood reflects the growing interest of musicians
in these forms, both secular and religious, which preceded the Renaissance.<a class="fn" href="#fnx6_33" id="frx6_33">[33]</a></p>
<p>To summarize the characteristic marks of the processional hymn which
are constant and quite independent of the date of their appearance, the
student must recall the underlying motives: 1) supplication in the litanies,
2) re-enactment of biblical scenes and 3) religious pilgrimage. Respecting
usage, the special interest of a ceremony devoted to a particular occasion
is present in processional hymns, additional to other rites. Lastly, a group
of hymns has come into existence, not to be classified with the more formal
categories of the office hymn and the sequence but dedicated to an extra-liturgical
purpose.</p>
<p>As a group, the processional hymns are not well-known or frequently
used in translation with the exception of the ageless hymns of Theodulphus
and especially of Fortunatus whose processionals usurped the medieval
field for over one thousand years and are still current to-day.</p>

<h2 id="c8"><span class="jr small">CHAPTER SEVEN</span>
<br />Influence and Survival of Latin Hymns</h2>
<h3 id="sc25">I. <span class="sc">Late Medieval Influence</span></h3>
<p>From the creation of the Latin hymn in the fourth century by the
earliest writers to the efforts of poets heralding the Renaissance, Christian
hymnody left its imprint upon contemporary verse both secular and religious.
The field of inquiry suggested by this thesis has never been fully
explored although it abounds in fascinating possibilities for the student of
medieval culture. The subject, of course, cannot be treated within the
limits of this chapter but such hints may be offered as have resulted from
a partial study of particular areas or fall within the bounds of reasonable
assumption.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most pervading influence and the simplest to trace is the
metrical. The iambic dimeter of Ambrose, both in its quantitative and in
its rhythmical form, became a standard for poetry of all types, appearing
even in the modern age as the long meter of the metrical versions of the
Psalms. Trochaic verse, initiated in hymns by Hilary, employed most
effectively by Fortunatus and always a favorite, rivalled the iambic in the
vernaculars. As the metrical features of the Victorine sequence became
increasingly popular, they were taken over bodily by secular poets writing
both in Latin and in the modern European languages. Classical meters
fostered by Prudentius and later by the Carolingian poets showed less
vitality as poetical models. The liturgical hymn and the sequence are of
prime importance in their metrical aspects but the meters of the <i>piae
cantiones</i> and other religious lyrics were also widely appropriated. The
origin of rhyme is a related problem which in the opinion of W. B. Sedgwick
&ldquo;centers around the Christian hymn.&rdquo;<a class="fn" href="#fnx7_1" id="frx7_1">[1]</a> Numerous publications by
scholars who, like Sedgwick, have spoken with authority, bear witness to
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
the general linguistic and literary interest attaching to these subjects of
research.</p>
<p>Aside from aspects of meter and rhyme, medieval secular verse in
Latin borrowed generously from the hymn; witness the songs of the
wandering scholars as recorded in the collection edited under the title
<i>Cambridge Songs</i> and also the goliardic poetry of the <i>Carmina Burana</i>.<a class="fn" href="#fnx7_2" id="frx7_2">[2]</a>
Well-known hymns are frequently parodied and, in general, the liturgical
models are employed to create humorous allusion or pungent satire. The
student song <i>Gaudeamus igitur</i> is a familiar illustration of this general
group.</p>
<p>The adaptation of the sequence to secular purposes resulted in a novel
type of verse, the <i>modus</i>, already cited in connection with the origin of
the sequence, illustrated by the <i>Modus florum</i> of which many examples
have been preserved varying in beauty and poetic conceit. Reference has
been made in an earlier chapter to the deeper problems underlying sequence
origins on the poetical side. Discussion among scholars as to the
priority of the religious or secular Latin lyric is still active.<a class="fn" href="#fnx7_3" id="frx7_3">[3]</a> Some would
say that popular Latin verse arose by virtue of the hymnodic influence.
Others would posit a vernacular impulse which eventuated in the Latin
lyric both secular and religious.<a class="fn" href="#fnx7_4" id="frx7_4">[4]</a></p>
<p>Apart from the lyric, there are in the general field of Latin verse
many resemblances to hymnic models. The lengthy narrative poems of
the <i>Peristephanon</i> in which Prudentius recounted the sufferings of the
martyrs, St. Laurence, St. Vincent, St. Agnes, St. Eulalia and others, and
celebrated their spiritual victories, have been called hymns. It has been
argued that they were actually sung,<a class="fn" href="#fnx7_5" id="frx7_5">[5]</a> in full, upon the festival days of the
saints in question although the praises of St. Vincent, for example, are
expanded to 576 lines, other hymns varying from 66 to 1140 lines. It may
have been possible in the more leisurely tempo of medieval life to render
the martyr hymns of Prudentius in their entirety. A far more provocative
suggestion makes them the starting point for the medieval saints&rsquo; legend
of which illustrations exist in lengthy Latin poems and later, in vernacular
verse.</p>
<p>The contribution of hymns to the liturgical drama of the Church has
been noted in connection with the sequence, <i>Victimae paschali laudes</i>. It is
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
nowhere contended that the hymn created the drama but that the dramatic
phraseology is often reminiscent of the hymn and that the role
of the singers in the <i>schola cantorum</i> and the choir, as actors in the liturgical
play, becomes significant in connection with the hymnic origins of these
productions within the church.<a class="fn" href="#fnx7_6" id="frx7_6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Finally, an interesting group of Latin poems having an interrelation
with the hymn is illustrated by <i>O Roma nobilis</i>, a tenth century lyric praising
the apostles and martyrs of the Eternal City (<i>A. H.</i> 51. 219).<a class="fn" href="#fnx7_7" id="frx7_7">[7]</a></p>
<p>The transition from Latin to vernacular languages took place as soon
as the latter were sufficiently developed to produce Christian verse. The
Gospels were rendered into Germanic rhymed verse in the ninth century
by Otfried the Frank who inserted a hymn of ten stanzas as a poetic
version of the opening of St. John&rsquo;s Gospel. It is written in seven-syllable
couplets with four or six to a stanza.<a class="fn" href="#fnx7_8" id="frx7_8">[8]</a> Otfried is said to have been influenced
by Rabanus Maurus and with good reason since the latter was a
recognized leader in mediating Latin patristic and other writings to the
Germanic world of his day.</p>
<p>Otfried was the first of many medieval poets whose religious lyrics in
the vernacular, often revealing the inspiration of the Latin hymn, have
been preserved. Their verse appears in Wackernagel&rsquo;s great collection in
which he has edited 1448 specimens from the time of Otfried to that of
Hans Sachs.<a class="fn" href="#fnx7_9" id="frx7_9">[9]</a></p>
<p>Celtic churchmen were pioneers among medieval Latin hymnists, their
earliest contribution dating from the sixth century. Religious lyrics in the
Celtic tongue must have been produced and recorded before the Danish invasions
although the destruction of these manuscripts delayed the compiling
of new vernacular collections until the eleventh century. The hymn
<i>Hymnum dicat turba fratrum</i>, written in trochaic tetrameter, and preserved
in the Bangor Antiphonary, to which reference has been made in
<a href="#c2">Chapter One</a>, apparently influenced the metrical system of Celtic poetry.
The metrical pattern used by Otfried, a quatrain of seven-syllable lines
with rhymed couplets, is commonly found.<a class="fn" href="#fnx7_10" id="frx7_10">[10]</a> Latin influence is at least
tentatively acknowledged by scholars in the rhyme and stanza structure
of Celtic poetry prior to the eleventh century.<a class="fn" href="#fnx7_11" id="frx7_11">[11]</a></p>
<p>After the creation of the Latin sequence, vernacular poetry is overwhelmingly
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
affected by this new type of hymn. Germanic poets followed the
leadership of Notker. The Victorine school, rejecting the strophic system
and rhythmic model of the Germans, built the couplet and rhyme, already
existing in hymns, into a characteristic structure which proved to be easily
transferable to vernacular uses. It has been asserted that the lyric poetry
of the Middle Ages, in German, French, Proven&ccedil;al and English was reborn
in this conquest of the vernacular by the Latin sequence.<a class="fn" href="#fnx7_12" id="frx7_12">[12]</a> At the
same time, the possible influence of the vernacular over the Latin must
not be ignored. There is a resemblance, for instance, between the narrative
elements of sequences written in honor of saints and the ballads of
secular poetry.<a class="fn" href="#fnx7_13" id="frx7_13">[13]</a> Whatever the conflicting currents may have been in the
period of origins, the smooth-flowing stream of the vernacular religious
lyric with its many tributaries, refreshed the spirit of medieval man and
recalled to memory his religious heritage.</p>
<p>The vitality of this new religious poetry which flourishes in the later
centuries, in which the Latin hymn suffered so marked a deterioration,
suggests that the future of the hymn, like other media of Latin literature,
was to be realized in a new linguistic environment. It was not the verity
but the language that was destined to change.</p>
<p>In order to appreciate the variety and interest of that vernacular lyric
poetry which arose within the sphere of influence of the Latin hymn,
illustrations may be culled from many parts of Europe. <i>Mary-Verse in
Meistergesang</i> is the title chosen by Sister Mary Schroeder for her study
of one aspect of the German lyric.<a class="fn" href="#fnx7_14" id="frx7_14">[14]</a> A very large proportion, perhaps two-thirds
of the songs are religious in content, showing to a degree, their
dependence upon hymnal poetry, while nearly one-fourth of them are
devoted to the praise of the Virgin. Occasionally, a Latin sequence has
been freely translated, paraphrased or elaborated.</p>
<p>The Swedish vernacular is represented by the patriotic poem of Bishop
Thomas of Str&auml;ngn&auml;s, who, in the fourteenth century, wrote in praise of
the national hero, Engelbrekt. Metrical and stanza form are both of the
hymnal type.<a class="fn" href="#fnx7_15" id="frx7_15">[15]</a></p>
<p>The Romance languages afford myriad examples of the sequence form.
St. Martial, near Limoges, already cited as a center in the production of
the sequence, and Paris, the home of the Victorine school, are both places
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
of origin for vernacular lyrics. A close connection has been traced between
the sequence and the French romantic lyric, especially the <i>lai</i>, a connection
amply illustrated and tabulated for the convenience of the student.<a class="fn" href="#fnx7_16" id="frx7_16">[16]</a> More
familiar, perhaps, than the <i>lais</i> are the appealing lines of Fran&ccedil;ois Villon,
&ldquo;Dame des cieulx, regente terrienne,&rdquo; which possesses all the charm of the
Marian lyric at its best.</p>
<p>About the year 1270, Alfonso X of Castile made a collection of 400
poems in the Galician-Portuguese dialect, the <i>C&aacute;ntigas de Santa Mar&iacute;a</i>
around which a considerable literature has grown up. All are devotional
in subject matter. Alfonso X was a literary patron. Ramon Lull (c. 1315)
was himself a poet who wrote in the Catalan tongue although his mystical
writings are better known than his poetry. His <i>Hours of our Lady St. Mary</i>
was modeled upon the hymn and set to a hymn tune.<a class="fn" href="#fnx7_17" id="frx7_17">[17]</a></p>
<p>The Italian poets of religious verse flourished as writers both in the
vernacular and in Latin. St. Francis of Assisi, (1181-1226), whose <i>Cantico
di fratre sole</i><a class="fn" href="#fnx7_18" id="frx7_18">[18]</a> is known and loved by countless persons in our own day,
was among the earliest poets of the <i>Laudi spirituali</i>. The origin of the <i>laudi</i>
has been traced in part to the ejaculations of the flagellants of northern
Italy where bands of these penitents were commonly seen in the thirteenth
century. A century earlier, religious societies of singers, the <i>laudisti</i>, were
in existence in Venice and Florence. Arezzo knew such a group as early as
1068.<a class="fn" href="#fnx7_19" id="frx7_19">[19]</a> Included among the known writers of <i>laudi</i> are Jacopone da Todi,
(1230-1306), and Bianco da Siena, (c. 1307), both classified today as
writers of hymns.</p>
<p>The movement represented by the <i>laudisti</i> spread to France, German-speaking
lands, the Low Countries and Poland. Everywhere the vernacular
was used with popular unison melodies. As we approach the Renaissance,
Florence is still conspicuous for her authors of the religious vernacular lyric,
among them Lorenzo di Medici and Savonarola, (1452-1498), better known
as the Florentine preacher whose passionate denunciations of the evils of
his day brought him into conflict with the Church and resulted in his
execution. His <i>Laude al crucifisso</i> has been translated in part by Jane F.
Wilde as a hymn, &ldquo;Jesus, refuge of the weary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The English religious lyrics of the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries may be read with enjoyment in the collections of Carleton Brown
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
whose appraisement of this poetry was the fruit of great learning and a
sympathetic discernment of human values.<a class="fn" href="#fnx7_20" id="frx7_20">[20]</a> Here the Latin hymn may
be found as it was translated, adapted and imitated in English verse. The
Latin sequence, as it increased in popularity, was taken over by English
poets with great success. Some of these writers who appropriated the Latin
models, like William Herebert, Jacob Ryman and John Lydgate, are known
to us by name while others are anonymous. Their poetic themes are varied
but Marian verse appears in many forms: hymns, laments, and rhymed
petition. Incidentally, a knowledge of the Latin original must be presupposed
on the part of the English laity of this period. Chaucer wrote
for the layman who must have understood his use of the sequence <i>Angelus
ad Virginem</i> in the &ldquo;Miller&rsquo;s Tale&rdquo; and the sequence <i>Alma redemptoris
mater</i> in the &ldquo;Prioress&rsquo; Tale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>English macaronic verse best reveals the Latin hymn. Over and over
again, Latin quotations are used, sometimes embedded in the text, sometimes
added as refrains, an understanding of which is always vital to the
appreciation of the poem.</p>
<p>The carol, although extraneous to true hymnody, because of its non-liturgical
character and usage, was related to Latin origins; to some extent,
to the <i>cantio</i> and the <i>conductus</i>. A form of vernacular lyric, the carol often
shares the macaronic features which were common in the blended phraseology
of the European languages with Latin in this popular type of late
medieval verse. It is relevant here as a religious lyric which bears the unmistakable
mark of the hymnic inheritance. Whatever is true of the English
carol is equally true of the carol in other lands. To-day these lyrics are of
great interest and of increasing usage in the Christian Church at large.
Their musical and poetic aspects are both subjects of enthusiastic research.
Many persons in our modern society who have never studied the classical
languages are able to sing the Latin words and phrases they contain, with
understanding, as did their medieval predecessors.</p>
<h3 id="sc26">II. <span class="sc">Influence and Survival of Latin Hymns since the Middle Ages</span></h3>
<p>The writing of Latin hymns by no means died out with the medieval
era in the sixteenth century. The great prestige of Latin studies fostered
by the Renaissance alone would have been sufficient to perpetuate the
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
practice. The Church, too, was engaged in a movement to standardize and
improve the Latinity of the breviary hymns which resulted in the Trentine
cycle as we know it today. A concurrent movement toward uniformity of
rites appreciably reduced the number of breviaries and the variety of their
hymns, but those breviaries which maintained an independent existence
had their own complete cycles. Such were the Cluniac Breviary of 1686
and the Paris Breviary of 1736 for which new hymns were written and
sung side by side with those of medieval origin. Among post-Renaissance
poets represented in these collections were the Frenchmen Jean-Baptiste de
Santuil and his brothers Claude and Baptiste. Freshly inspired by classical
studies, the new hymn writers repudiated medieval ruggedness and stylistic
neglect in favor of the smooth and finished Latinity affected by contemporary
poets. From the substantial body of verse produced in these
centuries, <i>Adeste fideles</i>, &ldquo;O come, all ye faithful,&rdquo; has proved a favorite.
Sometimes classified as a hymn, sometimes as a carol, it originated in the
English colony at Douay about the year 1740, from the pen of John Francis
Wade.<a class="fn" href="#fnx7_21" id="frx7_21">[21]</a></p>
<p>The continuity of the Roman Use, however, was not disturbed. The
Roman Breviary had acquired its cycle of hymns in the processes of evolution
which have been traced in the preceding chapters. Trentine revisions
under the guidance of Pope Urban VIII, (1623-1644), made with the
highest motives but often deplored by later scholars, transformed the
medieval originals into products of the Renaissance. The Trentine Breviary
contains many of the finest medieval hymns which, although they have
suffered alterations, have carried the traditional heritage into modern
times.<a class="fn" href="#fnx7_22" id="frx7_22">[22]</a></p>
<p>By virtue of its prestige and its world-wide circulation, the Roman
Breviary has been the vehicle by which the Latin hymn has penetrated
into the modern vernacular languages in translations. It is a subject of
frequent comment that the full treasury of hymns has not been drawn
upon by the Catholic Church since the hymns of the Roman Breviary have
monopolized the field. The historical reason for this is clear and also for
the fact that in the Roman Missal only five sequences, each of recognized
superiority, have been retained.</p>
<p>The restriction of Latin hymns in Roman Catholic liturgical usage
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
to a relatively small number allows certain exceptions. The Benedictine
and other religious orders use their own cycle of breviary hymns and
present-day Catholic hymnals in popular use often contain translations of
hymns and sequences additional to those of the Roman Breviary and Missal.</p>
<p>Protestant Churches are not limited in their selection of Latin hymns
for translation, making their choices from the entire medieval store. The
revival of Latin hymns in a translated form, which marked the Oxford
Movement in the Anglican Church in the mid-nineteenth century, drew
upon the Sarum Breviary as one native to English soil and therefore
appropriate to the English Church. That these hymns were largely represented
in the Roman Breviary, was well-known but the earlier and unrevised
texts were preferred. In his function as a translator, John Mason
Neale was preeminently a leader in the task of making known to the
adherents of the Church of England their heritage of hymns.</p>
<p>An attempt was made at this time to perpetuate not only the words
but the Gregorian Chant as a suitable musical setting for the vernacular.
Here the innovators were only partly successful and the chant, although
enthusiastically employed at first was gradually abandoned in the English
Church as the sole musical vehicle for the Latin hymn in translation.
Similarly Latin hymns have been taken over into other modern languages
by translators of Protestant as well as Catholic allegiance.</p>
<p>In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the influence of Latin
hymn meters continued to be felt in vernacular hymnody. Metrical versions
of the Psalms made by Isaac Watts are often illustrative of old Latin forms
which may also be recognized in his own hymns. This may not have been
a conscious imitation of Latin originals for by this time hymn meters were
ingrained in English poetry, but merely an indirect reflection, for example,
of the Ambrosian model.</p>
<p>More subtle has been the influence in modern times of the most
ancient canons of hymnic expression; objective presentation of scriptural
narrative, doctrinal emphasis and a certain joyful austerity in the praise
of God. During the three and a half centuries which have passed since
the era of the Protestant Reformation, the Christian hymn has experienced
a succession of literary movements, reflecting, for example, the spirit of
the Age of Reason and of the Romantic Era. Contemporary musical evolution
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
has, in turn, been vitally important to the growth of the hymn as
it has been mated with the melodies of the Genevan Psalter, the chorales
of Bach, the musical novelties of instrumental origin, the folk song and
latterly the native music of regions open to missionary enterprise.</p>
<p>Throughout this varied experience the stream of medieval Latin
hymnody has continued its course. As an accompaniment of Roman Catholic
worship this was only to be expected. The conquest by the Latin hymn
of areas beyond the limits of the Roman Church is more significant. The
most recent hymnals of leading Protestant denominations, to which the
Latin hymn in translation has made a modest but genuine contribution,
bear witness to the ageless character of this hymnody. Modern investigation
of hymn sources, their origins, authorship and influence, has created
the study of documentary hymnology as it is known today. In the processes
of this inquiry the medieval Latin hymn has been invested with
new interest in the minds of a multitude of worshipers, both Catholic and
Protestant, who have hitherto been unaware of, or indifferent to, their
common heritage.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
